## Secondary World Classifications (Session 94, issue #18)

WBH p.163 defines seven roles a secondary world can play in its system. The code
now checks eligibility and rolls in table order, assigning at most one
classification per inhabited secondary world or moon.

| Classification | Code | Requirements | Roll |
|---|---|---|---|
| Colony | Cy | Secondary Pop 5+, Gov 6 | Automatic |
| Farming | Fa | HZ, Atm 4–9, Hyd 2+ | Automatic |
| Freeport | Fp | Secondary Gov 0–5, TL 8+ | 10+; DM−2 if MW starport A/B |
| Military Base | Mb | MW TL 8+, not Poor, Gov 6 | 12+; DM+4 if MW has bases; DM+2 if secondary Gov 6 |
| Mining Facility | Mi | MW Industrial, secondary Pop 2+ | Belt: 6+; Terrestrial: 10+ |
| Penal Colony | Pe | MW TL 9+, LL 8+, Gov 6 | 10+; DM+2 if secondary LL 8+ |
| Research Base | Rb | MW Pop 6+, TL 8+, not Poor | 10+; DM+2 if MW TL 12+ |

`WorldDetail` gains `classification: Optional[str]` (emitted in JSON when set).
The code is also appended to `WorldDetail.trade_codes` so it appears in profile
displays. `_apply_classification()` is called from `generate_system_detail()`,
`_moon_detail()`, and `apply_secondary_social()`. `system_body_table()` appends
`[Classification Name]` to orbit and moon rows.

14 new tests in `TestSecondaryWorldClassification`. 1861 tests pass.

---

## Secondary Social Generation After Mainworld Selection (Session 92 cont.)

After mainworld selection gives the mainworld its real UWP, `apply_secondary_social()`
re-applies social data to every secondary WorldDetail using the correct mainworld
baseline. This includes re-rolling the population cap (`mw_pop − 1D`), and
regenerating population, government, law level, TL, spaceport, and trade codes for
all secondary orbit slots and their moons. The satellite WorldDetail created by
`attach_detail()` (which used placeholder values) is also synced.

---

## Mainworld Selection (Session 92, issue #125)

`select_mainworld(system, rng)` in `traveller_system_gen.py` scores all terrestrial
candidates and promotes the highest-scoring world to mainworld (WBH pp.155-156).
Scoring weights: Habitability ×50, Native sophonts ×50, Resource rating ×30,
Best refuelling ×10 (GG satellite = 2, hydro ≥ 5 = 1, else 0). On a 3D roll of
18 a candidate is selected randomly instead. When a secondary wins, the new
mainworld is regenerated via `generate_mainworld_at_orbit()` and the old
mainworld is demoted to a `WorldDetail`. Returns `True` when a swap occurred.

`WorldDetail` gains `native_sophont: bool` (set by `_set_biocomplexity()` when
biocomplexity ≥ 8; emitted in JSON only when `True`).

Exposed on system endpoints as `select_mainworld=true`; wired in FastAPI UI as
a "Select MW" checkbox. Not applied on TravellerMap or `from-world` paths.

---

## Deferred Social Generation — Physical-Only Worlds (Session 91, issue #124)

`generate_mainworld_at_orbit()` now returns a **physical-only** world (SAH,
atmosphere detail, hydrographic detail, gas giant/belt counts). Social steps
(population, government, law, starport, TL, bases, trade codes, travel zone)
are no longer rolled during system generation.

The new `apply_mainworld_social(world, rng=None)` function in
`traveller_world_gen.py` performs the deferred steps and must be called after
mainworld selection (a future issue). Until then, system-generated worlds carry
interim placeholder values: `starport='X'`, all social codes 0, empty bases and
trade code lists, and `travel_zone='Green'`.

**Note:** this is a seed-breaking change — any seed previously used with
`generate_full_system()` will now produce a different social outcome for the
mainworld because the social dice rolls have been removed from the sequence.

---

## FastAPI Web UI and gen-ui fixes (Session 93)

- **FastAPI web UI** — `fastapi/static/index.html` served at `/` (uvicorn redirects
  root to `/static/index.html`). Two-panel dark-themed page: Mainworld panel calls
  `/api/world/{name}/card` or `/api/world` (JSON); System panel calls card, full,
  or JSON endpoints with Detail/Full checkboxes. Seed badge is copyable. Server
  status indicator pings `/api/world?seed=1` on load.
- **gen-ui Chromium noise suppressed** — `QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS=--log-level=3`
  set before `QApplication` construction in `gen-ui/app.py`; silences the harmless
  `TASK_CATEGORY_POLICY: (os/kern) invalid argument` stderr line on macOS.
- **CLI flowcharts** — four Mermaid flowcharts added to `docs/`:
  `traveller_world_gen_flowchart.md`, `traveller_system_gen_flowchart.md`,
  `traveller_map_fetch_flowchart.md`, `system_map_flowchart.md`.

---

## FastAPI Server (Session 90)

A parallel REST server (`fastapi/`) exposes all 11 endpoints of the Azure
Functions API using FastAPI + uvicorn instead of Azure Functions.

- **No authentication** — designed to run behind a gateway or reverse proxy.
- **Rate limiting** — SlowAPI per-IP limiter; configurable via
  `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` env var (default `100/minute`).
- **Run locally** — `cd fastapi && uvicorn app:app --reload` (port 8000).
- **Test coverage** — 130 new tests in `tests/test_fastapi_app.py` using
  FastAPI's `TestClient`; no Azure SDK stubs needed.
- `fastapi/helpers.py` is a flat module (not `shared/`) to avoid import
  namespace conflicts with `azure-api/shared/` when both are on `sys.path`.

---

## Secondary World Independent Government (Session 89, issue #17)

Secondary worlds can now be generated as independently governed (WBH p.162
Case 2) instead of always using the captive/dependent government table (Case 1).
When the new **Independent government** option is enabled in the Options dialog,
every inhabited secondary world (terrestrial, belt, and moon) rolls government as
`2D − 7 + Population` — the same formula as a mainworld — instead of the 1D
captive table. The law level for Case 2 worlds with government 6 uses the
standard `2D − 7 + 6` formula instead of the captive-government relationship
table. `WorldDetail` gains an `is_independent_government` boolean field emitted
in JSON when `True`. The option is disabled by default and persisted in
QSettings.

---

## Larger Worlds for Non-Mainworld Terrestrial Bodies (Session 88, issue #113)

Secondary terrestrial worlds with size 10–15 (eHex A–F) now use the full WBH
`2D-7+Size` atmosphere formula. Previously both `_terrestrial_sah()` and
`_moon_detail()` in `traveller_world_detail.py` capped the size at 9 when
calling `generate_atmosphere()`, meaning a size-12 super-Earth got the same
thin atmosphere roll as a size-9 world. The cap is replaced with
`min(generate_atmosphere(size), 15)`, applying the correct size DM while
clamping to code 15 (F — Unusual Atmosphere) to exclude NHZ-only codes 16–17.
SAH encoding (`to_hex()`) and `WorldDetail.profile` parsing already handled
sizes A–F correctly; no other changes required.

---

# Release Notes — v1.4.0 (draft)

**Branch:** `v1.4.0` → `main`
**Sessions:** 55–87
**Tests:** 1686

---

## Terrestrial Resource Rating (Session 87, issue #105)

`WorldPhysical.resource_rating: Optional[int]` added. Computed at end of
`generate_world_physical()` as `max(2, min(12, 2D − 7 + Size + density_DM))`.
`density_DM`: +2 if density > 1.12 g/cm³, −2 if < 0.50. Always set for Size 1+
worlds. Public helper `apply_biological_resource_dms(rr, biomass, biodiversity,
compatibility)` applies deterministic DMs (no extra dice roll) inside
`attach_detail()` after `_apply_biomass()`. Displayed in world card and
`summary()` text output. `traveller_world_schema.json` updated with
`resource_rating` property in `WorldPhysical` section. 1686 tests pass.

## NHZ Atmospheres API Exposure (Session 87, issue #122)

`parse_nhz_atmospheres()` added to `shared/helpers.py` (same pattern as
`parse_orbital_eccentricity/inclination`). Wired into all five system
endpoint handlers in `function_app.py` and `_map_system_response()`.
`generate_system_from_world()` and `generate_system_from_map()` both gain
`nhz_atmospheres: bool = False` parameter and store it on the returned
`TravellerSystem`. Schema gains `$defs.system_generation_options` documenting
the three boolean flags that, together with `seed`, allow byte-identical system
reproduction. 9 new tests in `TestNhzAtmospheresOption`. Schema version bumped
to v1.4.1.

## Moon Ecc/Incl in Orbit Table (Session 87, issue #118)

`TravellerSystem` orbit-row builder now populates `"ecc_incl"` on each moon
dict. Non-ring moons with non-zero eccentricity or inclination show
`f"{eccentricity:.3f}/{inclination:.1f}°"`; rings and zero-value moons show `""`.
`system_card.html` moon sub-row `<td></td>` replaced with
`<td class="mono">{{ moon.ecc_incl }}</td>`.

## Gas Giant Mass/Density in Notes Column (Session 87, issue #119)

Orbit-row builder computes `gg_density = (gg_mass_earth / (gg_diam_km/12742)³) × 5.515`
when `gg_mass_earth` is set. Appended to `note_parts` as
`f"{gg_mass_earth:.0f} M⊕ · {gg_density:.2f} g/cm³"`. Notes column header
renamed from blank `<th></th>` to `<th>Notes</th>`.

## Gen-UI Onboarding Card (Session 87, issue #84)

`_show_placeholder()` replaced single dim label with `QFrame#onboard-card`
containing title, description, three-step workflow instructions, keyboard hint,
and TravellerMap note. `QFrame#onboard-card` added to both `_CSS` and `_CSS_DARK`.
Window resized to 1100×700 with minimum 780×500; `_apply_theme()` now substitutes
the actual system monospace font family name via
`QFontDatabase.systemFont(FixedFont).family()`.

## Injectable RNG for Deterministic Generation (Session 86, issue #42)

All generation modules now use injectable `random.Random` instances instead of
the global `random` module, eliminating shared-state hazards on warm Azure
Function instances and enabling isolated unit tests.

- **Module-level `_rng` pattern:** Each of the 8 generation modules
  (`traveller_hydro_detail`, `traveller_belt_physical`, `traveller_world_physical`,
  `traveller_world_gen`, `traveller_stellar_gen`, `traveller_orbit_gen`,
  `traveller_moon_gen`, `traveller_world_detail`) has a module-level
  `_rng: random.Random = random` sentinel. All `random.XXX()` calls replaced
  with `_rng.XXX()`. Public entry-point functions accept `rng: Optional[random.Random]
  = None`; when provided, they set `_rng = rng`.
- **`generate_world()` is seed-agnostic by default:** Only replaces `_rng` when
  an explicit `seed` or `rng` argument is given, preserving `random.seed()`
  behaviour for callers that rely on global state.
- **`generate_full_system()` always creates a fresh RNG:** `random.seed()` removed;
  replaced with `rng = random.Random(seed)` propagated to all sub-calls.
- **`TravellerSystem.seed` and `World.seed` fields added:** Both `to_dict()` emit
  `"seed"` when set; `from_dict()` restores it. Handlers in `function_app.py` no
  longer inject `d["seed"] = seed` manually — the seed comes from the object.
- **`apply_seed()` return type changed** from `int` to `Tuple[int, random.Random]`.
  All 13 handler call sites updated: `seed, rng = apply_seed(seed)`.
- **Cross-module propagation:** `traveller_map_fetch.generate_system_from_map()`
  uses `random.Random(seed)` and passes `rng` to `generate_orbits()`,
  `generate_hydrographic_detail()`, and `attach_detail()`.
- **`conftest.py` autouse fixture:** Resets every module's `_rng` to the global
  `random` module before/after each test, preventing order-dependent failures.

This is **not a seed-breaking change** — `random.Random(seed)` uses the same
Mersenne Twister as `random.seed(seed)`, producing identical sequences.

---

## GG Moons Near the Roche Limit (Session 85, issue #120)

Four related bugs in the gas-giant satellite tidal-stress pipeline, exposed by
seed 253115564 (TSF 644, TSS 1,256,530, total SS 1,257,174 — physically impossible).

- **TSS formula removed from GG block:** `_compute_tidal_ss` is calibrated for
  AU-scale star→planet distances; at moon distances (~0.1–0.8 Mkm) it amplifies
  results by ~10¹⁵×. The formula is no longer called for GG-satellite mainworlds;
  the `tidal_amp +=` amplitude contribution (already correct at all distances) is
  kept. Seed result: TSS drops from 1,256,530 to 0.
- **TSF capped at 500:** `tsf = min(math.floor(tidal_amp / 10), 500)`. Beyond
  ~500K-equivalent, material liquefaction limits further tidal dissipation. Seed
  result: TSF drops from 644 to 8.
- **Perigee Roche limit check:** After eccentricity/inclination rolls, any
  significant moon whose `orbit_pd × (1 − e) < 2.0` is tidally disrupted and
  converted to ring material. `ring_count` is incremented on the existing ring
  or a new ring created if none exists.
- **WBH GG mass roll:** New `_roll_gg_mass(gg_category)` in `traveller_orbit_gen.py`
  implements the WBH third-roll mass table (GS: 5×(1D+1)=10–35 M⊕; GM:
  20×(3D−1)=40–340 M⊕; GL: D3×50×(3D+4)=350–3,300 M⊕). Result stored as
  `OrbitSlot.gg_mass_earth` (Optional[float], serialised). Replaces the incorrect
  `gg_diameter ** 2` formula at all five call sites with a legacy-safe fallback
  (`orbit.gg_mass_earth if not None else float(diam ** 2)`). **This is a
  seed-breaking change** — adds 1–2 dice rolls per gas giant before the
  eccentricity block.

---

## gen-ui Dark Mode (Session 84, issue #81)

The desktop UI now supports a **dark mode** toggled via **View › Dark Mode**.

- `_CSS_DARK` stylesheet covers `QWidget` (main window background), `QGroupBox`,
  and all named `QLabel#` selectors with dark equivalents.
- Preference persisted across sessions via `QSettings("traveller-world-gen",
  "AppWindow")` key `dark_mode`.
- `_themed_html()` injects `data-theme="dark"` on the `<html>` tag at all three
  `setHtml()` call sites (world card, system card, mainworld tab), so HTML cards
  follow the in-app toggle rather than the OS `prefers-color-scheme` setting.
  `@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark)` blocks are preserved for API / browser export.
- `[data-theme=dark]` CSS blocks added to `system_card.html` (shorthand variables)
  and `world_card.html` (semantic variables).
- Toggling while a result is displayed live-refreshes the card without regenerating.

---

## System Card — MAO and HZ Columns (Session 83, issue #115)

The Stars table in the system HTML card now shows two additional columns:

- **MAO** — Minimum Armistice Orbit (Orbit# at stellar separation / 3). Populated
  from `SystemOrbits.star_mao`; shown as a 2-decimal-places Orbit# value. The
  primary star has no MAO and shows `—`.
- **HZ Orbit#** — inner edge, centre (HZCO), and outer edge of the star's
  Habitable Zone from `SystemOrbits.star_hz_inner`, `star_hzco`, `star_hz_outer`.
  Formatted as `inner – hzco – outer`; stars without an HZ show `—`.

`star_rows` in `TravellerSystem.to_html()` gains `mao`, `hz_inner`, `hzco`, and
`hz_outer` keys. The Stars table header gains `<th>MAO</th><th>HZ Orbit#</th>`.
No new tests needed — these fields are pre-computed at orbit-gen time and are
already covered by orbit-gen tests.

---

## System Card — Mainworld Detail Removed (Session 83, issue #114)

The `mw_data` construction block (~70 lines) has been removed from
`TravellerSystem.to_html()`, and the corresponding mainworld HTML section
(~200+ lines covering UWP stats, atmosphere, hydrographic, biological,
habitability, and notes) has been removed from `system_card.html`.

Mainworld detail now appears exclusively on the Mainworld tab in gen-ui via
`World.to_html()`. The System tab shows stellar data and orbital survey only.
Unused imports (`BeltPhysical`, `WorldPhysical`, `TIDAL_STATUS_LABELS`,
`BIOCOMPLEXITY_DESC`, `GOVERNMENT_NAMES`, `HYDROGRAPHIC_NAMES`,
`STARPORT_QUALITY_LABEL`, `format_atmosphere_profile`) were removed from
`traveller_system_gen.py`. No test changes needed.

---

## Ammonia Fluid Type Bug Fix (Session 83, issue #116)

`_fluid_type()` in `traveller_hydro_detail.py` incorrectly returned `"Ammonia"`
for Cold worlds with standard breathable atmospheres (codes 0–9). The WBH
specifies that ammonia oceans only form under exotic, corrosive, insidious, or
unusual atmospheres (codes 10–15). Standard atmospheres at Cold temperatures
should retain Water.

Fix: added `_AMMONIA_ELIGIBLE_ATMS: frozenset[int] = frozenset({10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15})` and a guard in `_fluid_type()`:

```python
if temperature == "Cold" and atmosphere not in _AMMONIA_ELIGIBLE_ATMS:
    return "Water"
```

6 new tests replace the previous single `test_cold_is_ammonia` test: separate
parametrised checks over standard atmospheres (0–9 → Water) and exotic
atmospheres (10–15 → Ammonia), plus integration tests covering both cases via
`generate_hydrographic_detail()`.

---

## Habitability Rating (Session 82, issue #106)

`generate_habitability_rating()` in `traveller_world_detail.py` computes the
WBH p.131 habitability rating (base 10 + DMs) for all terrestrial worlds.
DMs cover size, atmosphere (all codes including B/C/F+), hydrographics, solar
tidal lock, temperature (full path when `WorldPhysical` is available; fallback
to category string otherwise), and gravity (defined or undefined formula).
Gravity boundaries apply the worst-DM rule. Result clamped to 0 minimum.

`habitability_description()` added to `tables.py`. Field added to `WorldDetail`,
`World`, `to_dict()` / `from_dict()`, JSON schema, and `world_card.html`.
`_apply_habitability()` is called after `_apply_biomass()` in `attach_detail()`.
81 new tests in `tests/test_habitability.py`.

---

## Basic Mean Temperature — 1D+5 for Extreme Cold (Session 81)

`_compute_mean_temperature()` now rolls 1D+5 (giving 6–11K) when the
extrapolated result would fall below 10K (modified roll ≤ −34), per the WBH
p.47 footnote. Previously the code just clamped to 3K. This edge case only
arises for worlds at hz_deviation ≥ ~18.5 (extremely distant orbits).

---

## Tidal Heating Baked into Advanced Mean Temperature (Sessions 79–80)

`_apply_seismic_stress()` (called via `apply_moon_tidal_effects()`) now updates
`advanced_mean_temperature_k`, `high_temperature_k`, and `low_temperature_k`
in-place using ⁴√(T⁴ + TSS⁴) when TSS > 0 and the rounded value changes. The
former separate `advanced_seismic_temperature_k` display field has been removed;
the tidal heating correction is now reflected in the canonical temperature fields
used downstream.

9 new tests cover the `optional_inhospitable_rule` flag added in Session 78:
rule disabled (individual rolls), group roll < 12 (all NHZ worlds zeroed),
natural 12 (winner gets biomass roll; loser and its moons get 0), in-HZ worlds
unaffected, no group roll when no NHZ worlds, and the `attach_detail`
flag pass-through.

---

## Biological Pipeline — Edge-Case Test Coverage (Session 78, issue #112)

WBH p.130 Suggested Usage confirmed: limiting the full biological pipeline
(biodiversity, compatibility, lifeform profile) to the mainworld is correct; secondary
worlds receive only biomass + biocomplexity per rulebook intent.

32 new targeted tests verify:

- **NHZ codes 16 (G) and 17 (H):** biomass clamped to code 15 (F) via `min(atm, 15)`;
  biocomplexity DM-2 applies (not in [4–9]); compatibility DM-8 (same as vacuum) confirmed
  in `_ATM_COMPAT_DM` and exercised end-to-end.
- **Extreme HZ deviation worlds (|hz_dev| ≥ 3):** frozen/boiling worlds with atmosphere 0,
  1, 16, or 17 always produce `biomass_rating = 0` — demonstrated on both the simplified
  temperature-zone path and the K-temperature (WorldPhysical) path.
- **`atmosphere_detail = None` guard:** all three taint checks (`biologic`, `has_low_o`,
  `has_taint`) default to `False` when `atmosphere_detail` is `None`; `_apply_biomass`
  runs without error.
- **Biomass=0 short-circuit:** biodiversity, compatibility, and lifeform_profile remain
  `None` when the world is lifeless.

---

## System Map — World Marker Position (Session 77)

World glyphs on the orbit arc diagram now appear **one third of the way down
the arc** from the top endpoint rather than at the top endpoint. The change
improves visual clarity: markers no longer cluster at the very tip of short
arcs and sit closer to the horizontal centreline of the diagram.

Implemented as a one-line change to `_marker_xy()` in `system_map.py`:
angle changed from `half_deg` to `half_deg / 3`.

---

## Biodiversity, Compatibility, and Lifeform Profile (Session 76, issue #104)

Mainworlds with `biomass_rating ≥ 1` now receive two additional ratings and a
four-character eHex lifeform profile. All three are computed at the end of
`_apply_biomass()`, after biocomplexity and sophont checks, so they add exactly
four dice rolls per inhabited mainworld with no seed disruption for uninhabited
worlds.

### Biodiversity Rating

```
max(0, 2D − 7 + Biomass + ⌈Biocomplexity / 2⌉)
```

Higher scores indicate a richer variety of distinct species. No maximum.

### Compatibility Rating

```
max(0, 2D − ⌊Biocomplexity / 2⌋ + DMs)
```

DMs from WBH p.130: atmosphere code (vacuum/corrosive DM−8 through standard
DM+2), system age > 8 Gyrs (DM−2), "otherwise tainted" atmosphere (DM−2 for a
taint on a non-inherently-tainted code such as D or E). Full table in
`_ATM_COMPAT_DM` in `traveller_world_detail.py`. A rating of A (10) equals full
Terran compatibility.

### Lifeform Profile

Four-character eHex string `MXDC`: Biomass, Biocomplexity, Biodiversity,
Compatibility. Displayed in the Biological detail card below Biocomplexity.

### Data structures

New fields on `World` (all `Optional`, `None` when biomass = 0):
`biodiversity_rating`, `compatibility_rating`, `lifeform_profile`.
Emitted in `World.to_dict()`, restored by `World.from_dict()`,
added to JSON schema, and displayed in `templates/world_card.html`.

New public functions in `traveller_world_detail.py`:
`generate_biodiversity_rating(biomass, biocomplexity) -> int` and
`generate_compatibility_rating(biocomplexity, atm, age_gyr, has_taint) -> int`.

17 new tests in `TestBiodiversityRating` and `TestCompatibilityRating`
in `tests/test_biomass.py`.

---

## WorldDetail Round-Trip — Secondary World Detail Restored on Load (Session 75, issue #109)

`OrbitSlot.from_dict()` now fully reconstructs the `WorldDetail` block for
every orbit slot when a saved system JSON is opened. Previously the `"detail"`
key was silently discarded, so secondary world profiles (SAH, social data,
moons, physical) were absent after loading.

Three new `from_dict()` classmethods implement the reconstruction chain:

- **`Moon.from_dict(d)`** in `traveller_moon_gen.py` — parses the `"size"`
  string back to a size code (`_EHEX.index()`), restores all post-init orbit
  fields (`orbit_pd`, `orbit_km`, `orbit_period_hours`, `orbit_eccentricity`,
  `orbit_inclination`), and recursively calls `WorldDetail.from_dict()` for
  nested moon detail via a local import.
- **`WorldDetail.from_dict(d)`** in `traveller_world_detail.py` — calls
  `__init__` with the constructor params, overrides `trade_codes` from the
  saved list, reconstructs `physical` (dispatching to `BeltPhysical.from_dict()`
  or `WorldPhysical.from_dict()` based on the `"inner_au"` key presence), and
  restores `biomass_rating` and `biocomplexity_rating`.
- **`OrbitSlot.from_dict()`** updated — when a `"detail"` key is present, the
  slot's `detail` attribute is populated by `WorldDetail.from_dict()` via a
  local import; `detail_attached` is treated as `True` by the HTML renderer.

Circular imports are handled with local imports (the same `# pylint: disable=import-outside-toplevel` pattern used elsewhere in the codebase).

19 new tests across `TestMoonFromDict`, `TestWorldDetailFromDict`, and
`TestOrbitDetailRoundtrip` in `tests/test_system_roundtrip.py`.

---

## Bug Fix — `has_gas_giant` Preserved in World JSON Round-Trip (Session 74, issue #110)

`World.from_dict()` was re-deriving `has_gas_giant` as `gas_giant_count > 0`
instead of reading the saved boolean directly. This produced incorrect results
for any world where `has_gas_giant` and `gas_giant_count` disagreed (e.g., a
world that never had a gas giant but for which the count was non-zero due to a
data quirk, or vice versa).

Fix: `has_gas_giant=bool(d.get("has_gas_giant", gas_giant_count > 0))` — reads
the saved boolean when present, falls back to `gas_giant_count > 0` for legacy
JSON files that predate the explicit field. Backward-compatible.

3 new tests in `TestWorldDetailRoundtrip` covering: explicit `True` with count 0,
explicit `False`, and absent key with count 3 (legacy fallback).

---

## Open System JSON (Session 73, issue #108)

File > Open JSON… now fully supports system JSON files (previously showed "not
yet supported"). The full reconstruction chain was added across three modules:

- `Star.from_dict()` and `StarSystem.from_dict()` in `traveller_stellar_gen.py`
- `OrbitSlot.from_dict()` and `SystemOrbits.from_dict()` in `traveller_orbit_gen.py`
- `TravellerSystem.from_dict()` in `traveller_system_gen.py`

On load the system renders in the two-tab view; Save As… and System Map are
enabled. `OrbitSlot.detail` is not reconstructed — the system displays with
`detail_attached=False` (secondary world profiles absent). 16 new tests in
`tests/test_system_roundtrip.py`.

---

## File Menu: Save As and Open JSON (Session 72, issues #75 + #107)

The result header action buttons (Open in Browser, format dropdown, Save) have
been moved to a standard **File** menu in the menu bar, and the Open in Browser
action has been replaced with **Open JSON**.

- **File > Open JSON…** — always enabled; opens a JSON file saved by the app,
  version-checks the embedded `_app_version` tag, and re-renders the world card.
- **File > Save As…** (`Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`) — enabled after generation; saves as
  HTML or JSON (Text format removed). JSON output includes `"_app_version": "1.4.0"`.
- Version mismatch on open shows a `QMessageBox` error dialog; system JSONs show
  a "not yet supported" informational dialog.
- `APP_VERSION = "1.4.0"` module-level constant in `gen-ui/app.py`.
- `_write_html()`, `_open_in_browser()`, and `self._html_path` removed (temp
  file was only needed for the now-gone Open in Browser action).

---

## Biologic Taint (Session 71, WBH p.83, issue #28)

Atmospheric taints can now produce a Biologic subtype. Previously subtype dice
rolls of 4 and 9 (which map to Biologic per WBH p.83) were silently rerolled
because native-life ratings did not yet exist. Now that biomass generation is
fully implemented (Session 61), the reroll guard is removed and biologic taints
are enabled.

- `_BIOLOGIC_SUBTYPE_ROLLS` frozenset removed from `traveller_world_gen.py`.
- Subtype entries `4: ("Biologic", "B")` and `9: ("Biologic", "B")` added to
  `_TAINT_SUBTYPE_TABLE`.
- Reroll guard removed from `_roll_single_taint()`.
- When a biologic taint fires, `generate_biomass_rating()` enforces
  `biomass ≥ 1` via the existing `has_biologic_taint=True` parameter
  (already wired in Session 61 via `_apply_biomass()` in
  `traveller_world_detail.py`).
- Affected atmosphere codes: 2 (Reducing), 4 (Thick/Tainted), 7 (Standard
  Tainted), 9 (Dense/Tainted).

---

## gen-ui UX + Build improvements (Session 70)

### Belt temperature for asteroid belt worlds (size 0)

`BeltPhysical` now carries a `mean_temperature_k` field computed via the same
WBH p.47 Basic Mean Temperature formula used by `WorldPhysical`, with
atmosphere DM fixed at 0 (belts have no atmosphere).

- `traveller_belt_physical.py`: imports `_compute_mean_temperature` from
  `traveller_world_physical`; `BeltPhysical` dataclass gains `mean_temperature_k: int`;
  `to_dict()` emits it; `generate_belt_physical()` computes and passes it.
- Display: "Mean temperature" row added to the Belt body card in
  `templates/world_card.html`, `templates/world_list.html`, and
  `templates/system_card.html`; `render_system_json.py` belt branch gains the
  same row.
- JSON schema: `mean_temperature_k` added to `BeltPhysical` `required` and
  `properties`.
- Test updated: `test_to_dict_keys` in `tests/test_belt_physical.py` extended
  to include `"mean_temperature_k"`.

### TravellerMap loading feedback — async worker (issue #77)

TravellerMap lookups now run on a `QThread` so the UI stays responsive during
network calls.

- New `_TravMapWorker(QThread)` class with `result`, `failed`, and `ambiguous`
  signals; `run()` calls `generate_system_from_map()`.
- `_show_loading(message)` replaces the status panel with a centred dim label
  the moment Generate is clicked.
- `_start_travellermap_worker()` shows the loading label, disables the
  Generate button, and starts the worker.
- `_on_worker_result / _error / _ambiguous` re-enable Generate and dispatch
  to the correct finish handler.
- Disambiguation retry also goes through the async path.
- Old blocking `_do_travellermap_generation()` removed.

### Checkbox dependency hierarchy — QGroupBox (issue #79)

The flat `[Mainworld only] [Full detail] [NHZ] [Oxygen] [Advanced] [Runaway]`
row is replaced by a `QGroupBox("System detail")` with `setCheckable(True)`.
When unchecked (default), Qt automatically grays out all four child checkboxes
— the dependency relationship is now visually self-documenting.

- `_radio_mainworld_only`, `_radio_full_detail`, and `_detail_group` removed.
- `self._system_group = QGroupBox(...)` stores the new checkable group.
- `_on_detail_toggled()` reduced to uncheck-on-collapse and `_map_btn` enable.
- `_on_generate()` and `_build_system_summary_header()` use
  `self._system_group.isChecked()`.

### PyInstaller binary size reduction (issue #91)

- **37 unused Qt modules** added to `excludes` (estimated 100–150 MB saving).
- **`optimize=2`** replaces `optimize=0` — strips docstrings and assertions.
- **`strip=True`** replaces `strip=False` in `EXE` and `COLLECT` (~10–20 MB
  on Linux/macOS).
- **Translation file filter** on `a.datas` strips Qt `.qm` files (~30–50 MB
  on macOS).
- **Image format plugin filter** on `a.binaries` keeps only `qsvg`, `qjpeg`,
  `qgif`, `qicns`, `qico` (~10–15 MB on macOS).
- **macOS CI split**: single `macos` matrix row replaced by `macos-arm64`
  (macos-latest) and `macos-x86_64` (macos-13); `TARGET_ARCH` env var passed
  to PyInstaller; `target_arch` in the spec reads from the env. Each build is
  ~half the size of a universal binary.
- **UPX installed in CI**: `apt-get install upx` (Ubuntu), `brew install upx`
  (macOS), `choco install upx` (Windows), `dnf install upx` (Fedora).
- Release job updated to publish five artifacts: `macos-arm64`, `macos-x86_64`,
  `windows`, `ubuntu`, `fedora`.
- `BUNDLE version` updated to `1.4.0`.

---

## gen-ui UX Improvements (Session 69)

### Orbit table horizontal scroll (issue #76)

`templates/system_card.html` orbit survey table (11 columns) now scrolls horizontally when content overflows the panel width.

- Added `.table-scroll{overflow-x:auto}` CSS class.
- Added `white-space:nowrap` to `th` to prevent header line-wrapping under scroll.
- Wrapped the orbit `<table>` in `<div class="table-scroll">`.
- Shortened `Ecc/Incl` header to `e/i` in both `system_card.html` and `system_detail.html`.

No Python or gen-ui changes — pure HTML/CSS template fix. The native Qt orbit table had previously been replaced by `QWebEngineView` (sessions 66–68), which handles browser-native scrolling once the HTML container has `overflow-x:auto`.

### TravellerMap panel show/hide (issue #78)

The TravellerMap input fields (Sector, Name, Hex) and their vertical separator are now hidden entirely when Procedural is selected, rather than shown grayed out.

- `self._tm_panel` (grid widget) and `self._tm_vsep` (separator) stored as instance attributes in `_build_source_row()`.
- `_on_source_toggled()` calls `setVisible()` on both instead of `setEnabled()` on individual fields.
- Default startup state: panel and separator hidden (Procedural is default).

---

## Advanced Mean Temperature (Session 65, WBH pp.47-48)

Physics-based mean temperature calculation now available in the gen-ui as an optional "Advanced temperature" checkbox under "Oxygen requires biomass" (enabled only with Full detail).

**Formula:** `T(K) = 279 × ⁴√(L × (1−A) × (1+G) / AU²)`
- `L` — combined luminosity of all stars interior to the world's orbit (stars with `orbit_au ≤ 0` or `orbit_au < mw_orbit_au`)
- `A` — rolled surface albedo [0.02, 0.98]
- `G` — rolled greenhouse factor
- `AU` — world's orbital distance in AU

**Albedo (`_roll_albedo`):** World type set by density and hz_deviation:
- Rocky (density > 0.5): `0.04 + (2D−2) × 0.02`
- Icy (density ≤ 0.5, hz_deviation ≤ 2.0): `0.20 + (2D−3) × 0.05`
- Icy-far (density ≤ 0.5, hz_deviation > 2.0): `0.25 + (2D−2) × 0.07` (with negative low-roll adjustment)

Atmosphere modifier (thin/mid/very-dense/heavy groups) and hydrographics modifier (2–5 or 6+) applied additively; result clamped to [0.02, 0.98].

**Greenhouse factor (`_roll_greenhouse_factor`):** Initial = `0.5 × √bar`; standard atmospheres add a positive roll; exotic atmospheres multiply by a variable factor; extreme atmospheres by a larger variable factor. Atm 0 returns 0.0. When `pressure_bar` is `None` (unbound-pressure subtypes), 10.0 bar is used as a floor estimate.

**New `WorldPhysical` fields:** `albedo`, `greenhouse_factor`, `advanced_mean_temperature_k`, `high_temperature_k`, `low_temperature_k` — all `Optional`, present only when `generate_advanced_mean_temperature()` is called.

**Display:** World card shows "Adv. mean temperature", "High temperature", "Low temperature", "Albedo", and "Greenhouse factor" rows below the basic mean temperature row.

**Tests:** 30 new tests across `TestRollAlbedo`, `TestRollGreenhouseFactor`, `TestGenerateAdvancedMeanTemperature`.

---

## High and Low Temperature (Session 65, WBH pp.48-50)

`generate_advanced_mean_temperature()` now also computes seasonal high and low temperatures using the 9-step WBH procedure.

**Steps 1–4 — Variance:**
- Step 1: Axial Tilt Factor = sin(effective tilt clamped to [0°, 90°]); orbital year < 0.1 → ÷2; year > 2.0 → factor + min(0.01×year, 0.25), capped at 1.0
- Step 2: Rotation Factor = min(1.0, √|day_hours|/50); 1:1 lock → 1.0
- Step 3: Geographic Factor = (10 − hydrographics) / 20
- Step 4: Variance = clamp(ATF + RTF + GTF, 0, 1)

**Steps 5–6 — Luminosity Modifier:**
- Step 5: Atmospheric Factor = 1 + pressure_bar
- Step 6: Luminosity Modifier = Variance / Atmospheric Factor

**Steps 7–9 — Extreme temperatures:**
- Step 7: High Lum = L×(1+LM); Low Lum = L×(1−LM)
- Step 8: Near AU = AU×(1−ecc); Far AU = AU×(1+ecc)
- Step 9: High T = 279×⁴√(HighLum × (1−A) × (1+G) / NearAU²); Low T = same with LowLum/FarAU

**Private helpers:** `_axial_tilt_factor()`, `_rotation_factor()`, `_geographic_factor()`.

**Tests:** 42 new tests across `TestAxialTiltFactor`, `TestRotationFactor`, `TestGeographicFactor`, `TestHighLowTemperature`.

---

## Biomass Temperature DM Split (Session 65, WBH p.127)

`generate_biomass_rating()` gains a `high_temp_k: Optional[int] = None` parameter. The WBH p.127 temperature DM table has five rows split across two measures:

| Row | Condition | DM |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | High temperature > 353K | −2 |
| 2 | High temperature < 273K | −4 |
| 3 | Mean temperature > 353K | −4 |
| 4 | Mean temperature < 273K | −2 |
| 5 | Mean temperature 279–303K | +2 |

When `high_temp_k` is passed (from `WorldPhysical.high_temperature_k`), rows 1–2 use it directly. When `None`, `mean_temp_k` is used as proxy (backward-compatible). `_apply_biomass()` reads `advanced_mean_temperature_k` and `high_temperature_k` off `WorldPhysical` via `getattr` (no import dependency).

**Tests:** 11 new tests in `TestHighTempKSplit`.

---

## Native Sophont Generation (Session 64, WBH p.131)

Worlds and moons with biocomplexity ≥ 8 now roll for the presence of a native sophont species.

**Generation:** `generate_sophont_checks(biocomplexity, age_gyr) -> tuple[bool, bool]` in `traveller_world_detail.py`. Called from `_apply_biomass()` when `biocomplexity_rating >= 8`.

- **Current sophont:** 2D + min(biocomplexity, 9) − 7 ≥ 13. No DMs.
- **Extinct sophont:** Same roll + DM+1 if system age > 5 Gyr. Only rolled when current sophont check fails.
- Biocomplexity above 9 is capped at 9 for both rolls.

**Data structures:** `World.native_sophont: bool` and `World.extinct_sophont: bool` — both default `False`; set by `_apply_biomass()`. Emitted to JSON only when `True` (omitted when false).

**Display:** World card biological detail section shows a "Native sophont" row: "Extant" when `native_sophont`, "Extinct (evidence present)" when `extinct_sophont`.

**Tests:** 11 new tests in `TestSophontChecks` (`tests/test_biomass.py`).

---

## gen-ui: Radio Toggle and Tab Display (Session 64)

### Detail mode radio buttons

The "System detail" + "Mainworld detail" checkboxes have been replaced with a `QRadioButton` pair backed by a `QButtonGroup`:
- **Mainworld only** — generates a single world (same behaviour as the old unchecked System detail state). Default.
- **Full detail** — calls `generate_full_system()` + `attach_detail()` + `apply_moon_tidal_effects()` together.

"NHZ Atmospheres" and "Oxygen requires biomass" checkboxes remain; they are enabled only when "Full detail" is selected and cleared when switching to "Mainworld only". The "System Map" button likewise enables/disables with Full detail.

`_on_system_detail_toggled()` renamed to `_on_detail_toggled()`. No functional change to the generation logic.

### Two-tab system result area

`_show_system_summary()` now builds a `QTabWidget` instead of a flat vertical layout:
- **Tab 1 — System:** stellar card + orbits card in a `QScrollArea` (scrolls independently of the main window).
- **Tab 2 — Mainworld:** `QWebEngineView` rendering `mw.to_html()` (the full world card HTML). Default tab when a mainworld exists.

The former "Stellar && Orbits" toggle checkbox has been removed; tab switching replaces it. `_build_system_summary_header()` return type simplified from `tuple[QWidget, QCheckBox]` to `QWidget`.

---

## Biocomplexity Rating Test Coverage and Schema Fix (Session 64)

### Test coverage added

41 new tests in `tests/test_biomass.py` verify every DM condition for `generate_biocomplexity_rating()`:

| Class | Tests | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `TestBiocomplexityAtmosphereDM` | 9 | Atmospheres 0,3,4,6,9,10,12,13,15 |
| `TestBiocomplexityLowOxygenDM` | 3 | No taint / taint only / taint + atm DM stack |
| `TestBiocomplexityAgeDM` | 9 | All 5 age brackets at boundary and midpoints |
| `TestBiocomplexitySpecialCases` | 6 | Floor ≥ 1, biomass cap, cap invariance, DM stack, high-bio max, 50-seed sweep |

### JSON schema fix

`biocomplexity_rating` was missing from `traveller_world_schema.json` since Session 63 despite being emitted by `World.to_dict()`. Added alongside the new `native_sophont` and `extinct_sophont` fields:

```json
"biocomplexity_rating": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 1 }
"native_sophont":       { "type": "boolean" }
"extinct_sophont":      { "type": "boolean" }
```

---

## Bug Fix — Tidal Seismic Stress for GG Satellite Mainworlds (Session 64, issue #74)

When the mainworld is a moon of a gas giant, the tidal seismic stress formula
previously used the host star's mass and the world's stellar orbit — missing the
dominant tidal driver (the gas giant itself).

`_apply_seismic_stress()` gains two new optional parameters:
- `gg_mass_earth: float = 0.0` — gas giant mass in Earth masses
- `gg_satellite_moon: Optional[Moon] = None` — the `Moon` record for the mainworld's
  orbit around the gas giant (provides `orbit_km`, `orbit_period_hours`,
  `orbit_eccentricity`)

When both are present and `gg_satellite_moon.orbit_km` is set, a second
`_compute_tidal_ss()` call adds the gas giant's tidal contribution to the running
total; the gas giant's tidal amplitude contribution is also added to
`tidal_amplitude_m`. Both call sites (`gen-ui/app.py` and `function_app.py`) were
updated to supply these parameters.

---

## Bug Fix — Biomass Temperature DMs (Session 64, WBH p.127)

### Missing "High temperature" DM rows

`generate_biomass_rating()` was only applying three of the five WBH temperature DM rows. The table has two independent sections:

| Row | Condition | DM | Was applied |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | High temperature > 353K | −2 | **No** |
| 2 | High temperature < 273K | −4 | **No** |
| 3 | Mean temperature > 353K | −4 | Yes |
| 4 | Mean temperature < 273K | −2 | Yes |
| 5 | Mean temperature 279–303K | +2 | Yes |

Rows 1 and 2 apply in addition to rows 3–5. Using `mean_temperature_k` as the proxy for both measures (accurate for non-tidal-locked worlds):

- `mean_temp_k > 353` → DM−2 (row 1) + DM−4 (row 3) = **DM−6** (was DM−4)
- `mean_temp_k < 273` → DM−4 (row 2) + DM−2 (row 4) = **DM−6** (was DM−2)

The combined DM now matches the footnote simplified values: boiling/frozen worlds receive the expected −6 temperature penalty regardless of which path is used. The simplified zone path (when `mean_temp_k` is not available) was already correct and is unchanged.

7 existing `TestTemperatureKPath` tests updated; 3 new boundary/equivalence tests added.

---

## Biocomplexity Rating (Session 63, WBH pp.127–131)

Worlds and moons with non-zero biomass now receive a biocomplexity rating describing the most advanced organisms possible.

**Formula:** 2D − 7 + min(biomass, 9) + DMs. DMs: atmosphere not 4–9 → DM−2; low-oxygen taint → DM−2; age ≤ 1 Gyr → DM−10; ≤ 2 Gyr → DM−8; ≤ 3 Gyr → DM−4; ≤ 4 Gyr → DM−2. Worst DM used at exact age boundaries. Minimum result 1.

**Data structures:** `World.biocomplexity_rating: Optional[int]` and `WorldDetail.biocomplexity_rating: Optional[int]` — set by `_apply_biomass()` (after biomass is determined); `None` when biomass = 0 or not computed. `BIOCOMPLEXITY_DESC` added to `tables.py`.

**Display:**
- System card orbit table: new **Biosphere** column shows `B, C` (biomass eHex, biocomplexity eHex) for any terrestrial world or moon with biomass > 0.
- System card mainworld section: new **Native life** inner-card shows Biomass and Biocomplexity rows when biomass > 0.
- World card Physical characteristics: Biomass and Biocomplexity rows appear when biomass > 0.

**Rare Earth Variant** (WBH p.130): deferred — see `context/deferred-features.md`.

---

## Moon Orbit Eccentricity and Inclination (Session 62, WBH p.76)

Significant moons with orbital positions now have eccentricity and inclination rolled, reusing the world-orbit tables (WBH pp.27–28).

**Eccentricity:** `roll_eccentricity()` (previously `_roll_eccentricity`, now public) with no world-specific DMs — the base table only. Results in [0.0, 0.999].

**Inclination:** `roll_inclination()` (previously `_roll_inclination`, now public). Same table as world orbits; inclination > 90° implies retrograde. Results in [0.0, 180.0°].

Both are rolled only when orbit data is provided (i.e., `orbit_au` and `star_mass_solar` supplied). Rings are excluded. Fields default to `0.0` when orbit placement is skipped. The old `orbit_retrograde: bool` field is replaced by `orbit_inclination: float` — retrograde is now implicit from the angle.

**Display:** The "Ecc/Incl" column in the system orbit table moon sub-rows now shows `{ecc:.3f}/{incl:.1f}°` in the same format as world orbits.

**JSON:** `orbit_eccentricity` (4 d.p.) and `orbit_inclination` (2 d.p.) emitted inside each moon's dict when > 0.

**Seed impact:** Any system generated with System detail enabled will see shifted results for all dice following a moon eccentricity/inclination roll. The rolls are appended at the end of orbit placement inside `generate_moons()`.

**Tests:** 9 new tests in `TestMoonEccentricityInclination` in `tests/test_moon_gen.py`.

---

## Native Life — Biomass Rating (Session 61, WBH pp.127–131)

Biomass ratings are now generated for all terrestrial worlds and moons in a system.

**Generation:** `generate_biomass_rating()` rolls 2D with DMs from atmosphere, hydrographics, system age, and temperature (simplified zone or mean K when available). Combined DM is clamped to [−12, +4]. Roll ≤ 0 → no native life. Special Case 1 (biologic taint + rolled 0 → biomass 1) is implemented but dormant pending biologic taint generation. Special Case 2 (inhospitable atmospheres 0, 1, A, B, C, F+ → biomass adjusted upward) is active. The optional rule (oxygenated atmospheres minimum biomass 1) is implemented off by default — see **Optional rule** below.

**RNG placement:** All biomass rolls are appended at the end of `attach_detail()` via `_apply_biomass()`, preserving all existing seed outputs for other fields.

**Mainworld requirement:** Mainworld biomass is only computed when Mainworld Detail is enabled (`WorldPhysical` set). Secondary worlds and their moons always receive biomass ratings when System Detail is enabled.

**Data structures:**
- `World.biomass_rating: Optional[int]` — mainworld biomass (set by `_apply_biomass()`)
- `WorldDetail.biomass_rating: Optional[int]` — secondary world and moon biomass

**Display:**
- System card orbit table Notes column: "Biomass N" for any terrestrial world or moon with biomass > 0
- Mainworld physical card (World Body): always shows biomass rating when Mainworld Detail is enabled
- JSON output: `biomass_rating` field added to World schema (optional integer, min 0)

**Optional rule — "Oxygen requires biomass":** When enabled (`optional_biomass_rule=True` in `attach_detail()`), any world with an oxygenated atmosphere (codes 2–9, D, E) that rolls biomass 0 is raised to 1. In gen-ui, controlled by the **"Oxygen requires biomass"** checkbox (enabled only when System detail is active; cleared when System detail is disabled). No seed disruption when disabled. Rare earth variant remains deferred.

**Tests:** 72 new tests in `tests/test_biomass.py` covering all DM table entries, DM clamping, Special Cases 1 and 2, temperature paths, age DM cumulative application, and the optional oxygen rule.

---

## Optional Runaway Greenhouse Rule (Session 68, WBH p.79)

Physics-based optional rule: worlds with Atm 2–F and mean temperature > 303 K roll 2D + DMs for runaway; on 12+ the atmosphere converts and hydrographics are recalculated.

**Trigger:** `atmosphere` in 2–15 (codes 2–F) AND `advanced_mean_temperature_k > 303`. Requires Advanced temperature to be enabled.

**Roll:** 2D + ⌈age_gyr⌉ + `(temp_k − 303) // 10` ≥ 12 → runaway occurred.

**Outcome — Case A (Atm already A/B/C/F+, codes 10–12/15–17):** atmosphere code unchanged; world treated as Boiling for hydrographic recalculation.

**Outcome — Case B (Atm 2–9/D/E):** roll 1D (DM: size 2–5 → −2; tainted Atm 2/4/7/9 → +1) to select new code: ≤ 1 → A (10), 2–4 → B (11), ≥ 5 → C (12). Hydrographics recalculated with new code and "Boiling".

**Post-runaway:** `world.temperature` set to `"Boiling"`; `generate_hydrographics()` re-called; `generate_advanced_mean_temperature()` re-run with new atmosphere code (reflects corrosive/insidious greenhouse multiplier — does not trigger a second runaway check).

**New `WorldPhysical` field:** `runaway_greenhouse: Optional[bool]` — set `True` when runaway triggers; absent otherwise. Emitted in JSON and displayed as "Runaway greenhouse: Yes" in world card and system card.

**New function:** `check_runaway_greenhouse(atmosphere, temp_k, age_gyr, size) → Optional[RunawayGreenhouseResult]` in `traveller_world_physical.py`. Pure function; caller applies mutations.

**gen-ui:** "Runaway greenhouse" checkbox added under "Advanced temperature" (enabled only when Full detail + Advanced temperature are active; cleared when either is disabled). Controlled by `_maybe_apply_runaway_greenhouse()` extracted from `_finish_system_generation()` to keep pylint limits.

**Tests:** 20 new tests in `TestCheckRunawayGreenhouse` covering trigger conditions, DM calculations, roll threshold, Case A/B branching, new atmosphere code selection (die 1/3/6), size DM, tainted DM, and `to_dict()` integration.

---

## Hydrographic Fluid Type (Session 67, WBH pp.91–92, issue #20)

`HydrographicDetail` gains a `fluid_type: Optional[str]` field identifying the dominant surface liquid based on temperature zone.

| Temperature zone | Fluid type |
|---|---|
| Boiling | Sulfuric Acid |
| Hot / Temperate | Water |
| Cold | Ammonia |
| Frozen | Liquid Hydrocarbons |

Desert worlds (Hydrographics 0) and Gas/Hydrogen atmosphere worlds (codes 16–17) carry `fluid_type = None` — no free liquid surface.

**Display:** "Fluid type" row appears after "Surface liquid" in the hydrographic detail inner-card in all four output surfaces.

**JSON:** `fluid_type` emitted inside `hydrographics.detail` when present; added to `traveller_world_schema.json`.

---

## Stellar Day / Sidereal Day Correction (Session 66, WBH p.106)

`WorldPhysical` gains `stellar_day_hours: Optional[float]` — the solar day length (time between successive sunrises) computed from the sidereal rotation period and orbital period.

**Formula:** For prograde worlds: `1 / (1/day − 1/year_hours)`. For retrograde: `1 / (1/day + 1/year_hours)`. 3:2 resonance: `stellar_day = 2 × orbital_period_yr × 8766`. 1:1 lock: field omitted (star stationary in sky). Only set when orbital data is available.

**Display:** "Stellar day" row shown below "Day length" in World Body card when available. Tidally locked worlds show no stellar day row.

**JSON:** `stellar_day_hours` emitted in `WorldPhysical.to_dict()` when set; added to schema.

---

## gen-ui: System Tab HTML Rendering (Issue #86)

The System tab (formerly built from native Qt `QGroupBox` / `QLabel` widgets via `_build_stellar_card()` and `_build_orbits_card()`) now renders `system.to_html()` in a `QWebEngineView`.

- `_build_stellar_card()`, `_build_orbits_card()`, `_WORLD_TYPE_LABEL`, `_orbit_profile()`, `_fmt_period()` removed (~273 lines).
- The tab is populated by a single `setHtml()` call on the `QWebEngineView`, identical to the save-as-HTML output.
- Net result: `gen-ui/app.py` reduced by ~273 lines (1283 → 1010); the System tab now includes all columns, styling, and detail the HTML template provides, including moon sub-rows, biosphere data, and anomaly notes.

---

## PyInstaller Binary Builds (issue #65)

Cross-platform standalone executables can now be built using PyInstaller.

**New files:**
- `traveller_gen_ui.spec` — PyInstaller spec that bundles `gen-ui/app.py` as a one-file executable, collecting all template files, system data, and PySide6 Qt plugins. Template path resolved at runtime via `sys._MEIPASS` when frozen.
- `.github/workflows/build-binaries.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow that builds signed executables for Windows, macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon), and Linux on every push to `main`. Artefacts published as GitHub release assets.
- `docs/BUILD.md` — build instructions for local PyInstaller builds and CI workflow usage.

---

## World Physical Detail

### Tidal Stress Factor (Session 60, issue #67, WBH p.126)

`WorldPhysical` gains `tidal_stress_factor: Optional[int]` — the seismic stress
contribution from surface tidal forces.

**Formula:** `floor(tidal_amplitude_m / 10)` where `tidal_amplitude_m` is the
combined surface tidal amplitude (star + moons, computed by the Session 58 pipeline).

**Example:** A world with 30.6 m of moon tidal effect + 0.24 m star effect gives
tidal_amplitude_m = 30.84 → TSF = 3.

**Integration:** `total_seismic_stress` is now the sum of all three components:
Residual Seismic Stress + Tidal Seismic Stress + Tidal Stress Factor. Both
`tidal_amplitude_m` and `tidal_stress_factor` are set together inside
`_apply_seismic_stress()` via `_compute_tidal_amplitude()`.

Displayed in gen-ui World Body card, `world_card.html`, and `render_system_json.py`
in the order: Tidal Seismic Stress → Tidal Stress Factor → Residual → Total.
`tidal_stress_factor` is emitted to JSON and schema only when > 0.

6 new tests in `TestTidalStressFactor`.

---

### Surface Tidal Amplitude (Session 58, issue #68, WBH pp.107–108)

`WorldPhysical` gains `tidal_amplitude_m: Optional[float]` — the combined surface tidal
amplitude in metres from the primary star and all significant moons.

**Star effect:** `(star_mass_solar × size) / (32 × AU³)`. Sol acting on Terra ≈ 0.25 m.

**Moon effect per moon:** `(moon_mass_earth × size) / (3.2 × (orbit_km / 10⁶)³)`. Moon mass
estimated from size using Terran density: `(size × 1600 / 12742)³` M⊕ (same method used in
`WorldPhysical.mass`). Rings and moons without `orbit_km` are excluded.

**Pipeline:** `generate_world_physical()` stores a star-only preliminary value in
`tidal_amplitude_m`; `apply_moon_tidal_effects()` adds all moon contributions and updates
the field in-place.

**Display:** "Tidal amplitude: X.XX m" row appears after the Tidal status row in all four
output surfaces — gen-ui World Body card, `world_card.html` Jinja2 template,
`render_system_json.py`, and the JSON schema (`tidal_amplitude_m` added to the
`WorldPhysical` branch).

21 new tests across `TestStarTidalEffectM`, `TestMoonMassEarth`, `TestMoonTidalEffectM`,
`TestComputeTidalAmplitude`, `TestTidalAmplitudeIntegration`.

Also in this session: the pre-existing `_ZONE_OBJECT_NAME → ZONE_CSS_CLASS` name typo in
`gen-ui/app.py` was fixed, and `test_moon_lock_occurs_when_dm_high_enough` was patched to
be fully deterministic (the broken-lock check was a source of intermittent test flap).

---

### Seismic Stress (Session 56, WBH pp.125–128)

Seismic stress is now calculated for every mainworld with physical detail. Four fields
are added to `WorldPhysical`; all are `Optional[int]`.

**Residual Seismic Stress (RSS):** `floor(Size − Age_Gyr + DMs)²`. DMs: `is_moon` +1;
density > 1.0 +2; density < 0.5 −1; sum of significant moon sizes (Size 1+, non-ring),
capped at +12. Values < 0 before squaring yield 0.

**Tidal Seismic Stress (TSS):** `PrimaryMass⊕² × (diam/1600)⁵ × e² /
(3000 × dist_Mkm⁵ × period_days × WorldMass⊕)`. Rounded down; stored as 0 when < 1
(omitted from `to_dict()` when 0).

**Total Seismic Stress:** RSS + TSS (+ Tidal Stress Factor once Session 60 runs).

**Seismic Temperature:** `⁴√(mean_temp_k⁴ + TSS⁴)`. Set only when the result rounds
to a value different from `mean_temperature_k`; omitted otherwise.

**Display:** World Body card, `world_card.html`, and `render_system_json.py` all show
the seismic fields. `apply_moon_tidal_effects()` sets `is_moon=True` for gas-giant
satellite mainworlds and always runs `_apply_seismic_stress()` even when the moon list
is empty.

22 new tests in `TestResidualSeismicStress`, `TestTidalSeismicStress`, `TestApplySeismicStress`, `TestSeismicTemperature`.

## Bug Fixes

### Mainworld-as-moon row not bold in orbit table (Session 61)

When the mainworld is a satellite of a gas giant it appears as a moon sub-row in the system orbit table. It was rendered with the `table-moon` CSS class instead of `table-mw`, so the row was not displayed in bold like other mainworld rows. Fixed: `moon_css` is now `"table-mw"` when `is_mw and mi == 1 and orbit.world_type == "gas_giant"`.

---

### BeltPhysical crash in `apply_moon_tidal_effects()` (Session 59)

`apply_moon_tidal_effects()` was called for belt mainworlds (Size 0), passing a
`BeltPhysical` object where `WorldPhysical` was expected. Both the tidal lock
re-run and `_apply_seismic_stress()` access attributes (`density`, `axial_tilt`,
`tidal_status`, etc.) that exist only on `WorldPhysical`, raising `AttributeError`.

Fix: `apply_moon_tidal_effects()` now returns immediately when `physical` is not
a `WorldPhysical` instance. Belt worlds have no tidal lock or seismic stress fields,
so the early return is semantically correct, not just defensive.

---

## Maintenance

### gen-ui: eccentricity and inclination always calculated (issue #58)

The "Orbital Eccentricity" and "Orbital Inclination" checkboxes have been removed
from the desktop UI. Both flags are now always passed as `True` when "System detail"
is enabled, so the Ecc/Incl column is always populated.

---

### Rename: `tidal_heating_factor` → `tidal_seismic_stress` (Session 59)

The WBH term for the orbital tidal contribution to seismic stress is "Tidal Seismic
Stress", not "Tidal Heating Factor". Renamed throughout:

- `WorldPhysical.tidal_heating_factor` field → `tidal_seismic_stress`
- `_compute_thf()` → `_compute_tidal_ss()`
- JSON key `"tidal_heating_factor"` → `"tidal_seismic_stress"`
- JSON schema property and description updated
- Display label in gen-ui, `world_card.html`, and `render_system_json.py`
- Tests updated (`TestComputeThf` → `TestComputeTidalSS`)

Formula and logic unchanged. Total Seismic Stress = Residual Seismic Stress +
Tidal Seismic Stress.

---

### Static typing — enum types (issue #38)

Five `StrEnum` / `IntEnum` types added to a new `world_codes.py` module, compatible with all existing `str` / `int` comparisons and JSON serialisation.

| Enum | Values |
|---|---|
| `StarportCode` (`StrEnum`) | `A B C D E X` |
| `TemperatureCategory` (`StrEnum`) | `Frozen Cold Temperate Hot Boiling` |
| `TradeCode` (`StrEnum`) | all 18 codes (`Ag As Ba De Fl Ga Hi Ht Ic In Lo Lt Na Ni Po Ri Va Wa`) |
| `TravelZone` (`StrEnum`) | `Green Amber Red` |
| `AtmosphereCode` (`IntEnum`) | codes 0–17 |

**`parse_uwp()` validation (`traveller_map_fetch.py`):** The UWP parser now raises `ValueError` (with chained exception context via `from exc`) for any of: wrong length, missing `-` separator at position 7, unrecognised starport letter, or non-hex digit in code positions. Previously it silently substituted defaults for malformed input.

**`World._validate_world_codes()` (`traveller_world_gen.py`):** New static method called at the top of `World.from_dict()`. Validates starport, atmosphere, temperature, trade codes, travel zone, and all integer range fields against the enum types and schema constraints. All validation failures raise `ValueError` with a descriptive message and chained exception context.

**Pyright CI:** `.github/workflows/typecheck.yml` added — runs `pyright` on every push/PR to `main`. `pyrightconfig.json` updated (`typeCheckingMode: "basic"`, explicit `exclude` list re-specifying all default patterns). `requirements-dev.txt` gains `pyright>=1.1.0`. Eight pre-existing Pyright errors in `traveller_world_gen.py`, `traveller_world_physical.py`, and `traveller_world_detail.py` were fixed: stored-boolean narrowing replaced with inline `isinstance()`, `Moon` forward reference resolved via `TYPE_CHECKING` guard, `hasattr()` narrowing replaced with `isinstance()`.

---

### Centralised display tables (issue #39)

Seven display-layer lookup tables previously duplicated across two to three files have been consolidated into a new `tables.py` module — a single definition is now the canonical source for each label set.

| Table | Previously defined in |
|---|---|
| Size → diameter label | `traveller_world_gen.py` ×2 |
| Size → gravity label | `traveller_world_gen.py` ×2 |
| Population → range label | `traveller_world_gen.py` ×2 |
| Trade code full names | `traveller_world_gen.py`, `gen-ui/app.py` |
| Base facility labels | `traveller_world_gen.py`, `gen-ui/app.py`, `render_system_json.py` |
| Travel zone → CSS class | `traveller_world_gen.py`, `gen-ui/app.py`, `render_system_json.py` |
| Tidal lock status labels | `traveller_world_physical.py`, `render_system_json.py` |

All five consumer files (`traveller_world_gen.py`, `traveller_system_gen.py`, `render_system_json.py`, `gen-ui/app.py`, `tests/test_world_physical.py`) now import from `tables`. No display output was changed.

---

### Pylint

`.pylintrc` restored after accidental deletion in commit f9f6ca1. The `[MESSAGES CONTROL]` block suppresses two structural false positives with inline documentation:

- `duplicate-code` — identical pipeline boilerplate exists across five entry-point files; several data-table copies are intentional to break circular imports. Tracked for future refactoring.
- `cyclic-import` — pre-existing `traveller_system_gen` → `traveller_world_detail` cycle resolved at runtime via `TYPE_CHECKING` guard. Tracked for cleanup.

Pylint 10.00/10 maintained across all core generation modules.

---

# Release Notes — v1.2.0

**Branch:** `feature/updates` → `main`
**Sessions:** 36–54
**Tests:** 1146

---

## Maintenance

### Static type-checking (Pyright / Pylance)

`pyrightconfig.json` added to the project root so Pylance resolves imports from
the project root (`extraPaths: ["."]`) consistent with the runtime `sys.path` that
`conftest.py` establishes for pytest.

All six test files made fully Pyright-clean (0 errors, 0 warnings):

| File | Issues fixed |
|------|-------------|
| `test_belt_physical.py` | 2 unguarded `system.mainworld` accesses |
| `test_function_app.py` | Azure stub used direct attribute assignment on `ModuleType` (→ `setattr()`); 4 unguarded `err` accesses |
| `test_hydro_detail.py` | 4 unguarded `generate_hydrographic_detail()` return accesses |
| `test_moon_gen.py` | `list[float | None]` not narrowed through intermediate comprehension |
| `test_traveller_world_gen.py` | Two pairs of shadowed class names; `Optional` attribute guards; `comp.orbit_number` arithmetic guards |
| `test_world_physical.py` | `_World` stub now inherits from `World`; mixed-type `**kwargs` dicts annotated `dict[str, Any]` |

**Notable bug found:** `TestWorldToDict` and `TestWorldToJson` were each declared
twice in `test_traveller_world_gen.py`. Python's namespace rules mean the second
definition silently replaced the first, so the first class's tests **never ran**.
The first instances are renamed `TestWorldToDictValues` and `TestWorldToJsonBasic`;
61 previously-invisible tests now execute.

**Source fix:** `World.to_json(indent: int = 2)` signature corrected to
`indent: Optional[int] = 2`, matching the docstring ("Pass `None` for compact
single-line output") and the `json.dumps` behaviour already in use.

**1146 tests** pass (1085 previously confirmed + 61 now un-shadowed).

---

## Improvements

### Basic Mean Temperature (Session 54, WBH p.47)

`WorldPhysical` gains `mean_temperature_k: Optional[int]` — the Basic Mean Temperature
in Kelvin computed from orbital position and atmosphere code.

**Formula:** modified roll = 7 (base/HZCO) + orbital DM + atmosphere DM.
Orbital DMs: `+4 +1 per 0.5 Orbit# below HZCO-1`; `−4 −1 per 0.5 Orbit# above HZCO+1`.
Atmosphere DMs are the same HZ Regions table DMs used for temperature categories.
Table lookup covers rolls 0–12 (178K–388K); extrapolates below 0 (−5K/step) and
above 12 (+50K/step); minimum 3K.

**Call sites:** `generate_world_physical()` gains `hz_deviation: Optional[float] = None`
parameter; `function_app._attach_mainworld_physical()` and `gen-ui/app.py` both pass
`mw_orbit.hz_deviation`. Value is absent when hz_deviation is not available (e.g., simple
standalone world generation without orbit context).

**Display:** all four HTML templates gain a "Mean temperature" row after "Day length";
`render_system_json.py._phys_rows()` and `traveller_world_schema.json` updated.

17 new tests in `TestOrbitDmForMeanTemp` (7) and `TestComputeMeanTemperature` (10);
**1085 tests** pass.

### HTML Template Refactor (Session 53, issue #40)

`World.to_html()` and `TravellerSystem.to_html()` now use Jinja2 templates
instead of hand-built f-strings. This eliminates doubled braces in CSS blocks,
makes the HTML structure directly editable without touching Python, and enables
Jinja2's built-in autoescaping (replaces the custom `esc()` helper).

**New files:**
- `html_render.py` — thin rendering module with a module-level `jinja2.Environment`
- `templates/world_card.html` — single world card
- `templates/world_list.html` — multi-world list (used by `--html` with multiple worlds)
- `templates/system_card.html` — full system card

**`requirements.txt`** gains `Jinja2>=3.1.0`.

The multi-world CLI `--html` output was previously stitched together with a fragile
regex that re-parsed each card's HTML. It now uses `world_list.html` directly.

---

## New Features

### Moon Tidal Lock DMs and Planet-to-Moon Lock (Session 52, WBH pp.106–107, issue #11)

Moon orbital positions (added in Session 51) unlock two previously deferred tidal effects.

**Moon-size DM in star-lock (WBH p.106):** `_tidal_lock_dm()` now subtracts the total size of all significant moons (Size 1+, non-ring) from the tidal lock DM when evaluating planet-to-star lock.

**Multi-star DM (WBH p.106):** `_tidal_lock_dm()` subtracts the number of stars orbited when > 1. Currently simplified to `num_stars_orbited=1` (full multi-star support deferred); the parameter is wired through the full call chain.

**Planet-to-moon lock (WBH p.107):** New `_planet_moon_lock_dm(moon, all_moons)` implements the WBH p.107 DM table: base −10, +Moon Size (Size 1+), PD-range DMs (orbit PD < 5: `+5 + ceil((5−PD)×5)`, 5–10: +4, 10–20: +2, 20–40: +1, 40–60: no DM, > 60: −6), −2 per moon beyond the first.

**Lock candidate ordering:** `_roll_tidal_lock_status()` now assembles all candidates (star + each qualifying moon), sorts by highest DM (moon before star on tie), and cascades until a lock result is found or all candidates are exhausted.

**Circular dependency resolution:** `WorldPhysical` needs moon data for DMs, but moons need `WorldPhysical` (diameter/mass) for Hill sphere. A new public `apply_moon_tidal_effects(physical, moons, ...)` function resolves this via a three-phase pipeline: `generate_world_physical()` runs first (no moon DMs), moons are generated using actual planet mass/diameter, then `apply_moon_tidal_effects()` re-runs tidal lock with full moon data and mutates `WorldPhysical` in-place.

New helpers in `_get_mainworld_moons()` and `_apply_mainworld_moon_tidal()` in `function_app.py` handle both GG satellite (moons at `orbit.detail.moons[0].detail.moons`) and non-GG (moons at `orbit.detail.moons`) cases. `gen-ui/app.py` `_finish_system_generation()` calls `apply_moon_tidal_effects()` after detail attachment.

24 new tests across `TestTidalLockDmMoon` (8), `TestPlanetMoonLockDm` (10), `TestRollTidalLockStatusMoons` (3), `TestApplyMoonTidalEffects` (3); **1068 tests** pass.

---

### Moon Quantity Adjacency DMs (Session 52, WBH p.56, issue #14)

Three of the four WBH p.56 moon quantity DM conditions that were previously deferred (blocked on moon orbital positions) are now implemented.

`_moon_quantity()` in `traveller_moon_gen.py` gains three new optional parameters, applied as `DM−1 per dice` when any condition is met (only one DM applies per world):

| Condition | Parameter |
|-----------|-----------|
| Planet orbit within companion star exclusion zone (±1 to +3 of companion orbit#) | `companion_exclusion_zones: list[tuple]` |
| Planet orbit adjacent to host star MAO boundary (±1.0) | `star_mao: float` |
| Planet orbit adjacent to outermost Far-star slot (±1.0) | `is_adjacent_outermost_far: bool` |

The fourth condition (`orbit_number < 1.0`) was already implemented. `generate_moons()` passes through the three new parameters.

`_moon_adjacency_context()` in `traveller_world_detail.py` computes these values from the system context (iterating `stellar_system.stars` for companions and Far stars, reading `system_orbits.star_mao`). The context dict is passed to `_moons_for()` and forwarded to both `generate_moons()` call sites in `generate_system_detail()` and `attach_detail()`.

8 new tests in `TestMoonQuantityAdjacencyDMs`; **1044 tests** after this feature (1068 after both features in Session 52).

---

### Moon Orbit Placement (Session 51, WBH pp.74–77, issue #16)

Moons now have orbital positions. `generate_moons()` accepts five new optional parameters (`orbit_au`, `star_mass_solar`, `planet_ecc`, `planet_diameter_km`, `planet_mass_earth`); when `orbit_au > 0` and `star_mass_solar > 0` the full orbit placement pipeline runs.

**Hill sphere** caps the outer moon limit: `Hill_AU = orbit_au × (1 − ecc) × ∛(mass_earth × 3e-6 / (3 × star_mass_solar))`, converted to PD by dividing by planet diameter. The practical moon limit is `floor(Hill_PD / 2)`.

**Moon removal:** if the moon limit is < 1 PD, no moons or rings survive; if 1 PD, significant moons are converted to a ring.

**Moon Orbit Range** = `Moon Limit − 2` (capped at `200 + n_moons`). Each moon rolls independently on the Inner/Middle/Outer table (DM+1 when MOR < 60), PDs are sorted ascending (closest-first), and adjacent collisions are resolved by bumping the outer moon out 1 PD.

**Orbital period** in hours: `√(orbit_km³ / mass_earth) / 361730`.

**Ring placement:** centre = `0.4 + roll(2)/8` PD, span = `roll(3)/100 + 0.07` PD; inner edge clamped ≥ 0.55 PD.

For secondary worlds (no `WorldPhysical`), mass and diameter are estimated from size code. For the mainworld, `WorldPhysical.diameter_km` and `WorldPhysical.mass` are used directly. `attach_detail()` and `_moons_for()` automatically pass orbit data to `generate_moons()`.

Moon orbit eccentricity and retrograde direction (WBH p.76) are deferred; the fields exist on `Moon` but default to 0.0/False.

22 new tests in `tests/test_moon_gen.py`; **1036 tests** pass.

---

### Tidal Lock Eccentricity DM (Session 50, WBH p.105)

The eccentricity DM for the Tidal Lock Status table is now applied. WBH p.105 specifies this as a general DM for all cases: when `eccentricity > 0.1`, apply `DM − floor(eccentricity × 10)`. Examples: e=0.25 → DM−2; e=0.50 → DM−5; e=0.999 → DM−9.

`_tidal_lock_dm()` gains `orbit_eccentricity: float = 0.0` as a new parameter; threaded through `_roll_tidal_lock_status()` and into `generate_world_physical()` (which already accepted `orbit_eccentricity` since Session 44). No seed disruption when `orbital_eccentricity=False` (default) — the parameter defaults to 0.0 and applies no DM. When the flag is True, tidal lock outcomes for worlds with `eccentricity > 0.1` will shift (fewer locks for eccentric orbits).

The stale "Orbital eccentricity" entry has been removed from `context/deferred-features.md` — that feature was fully implemented across Sessions 43 (orbital eccentricity rolls) and 48 (anomalous orbit DMs).

6 new tests in `TestTidalLockEccentricityDm`; **1014 tests** pass.

---

### System JSON HTML Renderer (Session 49)

New standalone script `render_system_json.py` reads any system JSON file produced by `TravellerSystem.to_dict()` and renders it as a rich, self-contained HTML document. No project module imports are required — the script uses Python stdlib only (`json`, `sys`, `html`, `pathlib`).

**Usage:**
```bash
python render_system_json.py system.json [output.html]
```
Output defaults to `<input-stem>.html` in the same directory.

**Rendered sections:**
- System header (name, age, star count, seed, mainworld UWP)
- Stars table (designation, type, mass, temperature, diameter, luminosity, orbit, period)
- Habitable zones summary (per star: HZ range, MAO, temperature zone)
- World count chips (gas giants, belts, terrestrials, total, empty)
- Orbital survey table — 11 columns: Star, #, Orbit#, AU, Period, Ecc/Incl, Type, Profile, Codes, Zone, Notes; moon sub-rows when `attach_detail()` has been called
- Mainworld panel: 11-cell stats grid, trade code badges, World Body card (WorldPhysical or BeltPhysical), atmosphere detail card (profile, pressure, O₂, scale height, taints, gas mix, altitude bands), hydrographic detail card, notes
- Raw JSON collapsible `<details>` block

Distinguishes `WorldPhysical` vs `BeltPhysical` by checking for `"composition"` key. CSS matches the existing `to_html()` design: CSS variables, dark mode, colour-coded temperature zones, trade code badges. Pylint 10.00/10.

Sample output: `examples/system_seed42.html` (seed=42, 3-star system named Aramis, mainworld UWP D200000-0, full eccentricity + inclination).

---

### Orbital Inclination (Session 46, issue #59)

WBH p.28 orbital inclination is now implemented as an optional gated feature using the same pattern as orbital eccentricity.

**`_roll_inclination()`** uses a 6-row severity table (2D ≤ 6 = Very Low through 2D = 11 = Extreme), each with a different degree formula, plus a recursive retrograde case (2D = 12 → `180 − re-roll`). Anomalous orbits already typed as `"inclined"` are skipped (their angle is stored in `notes`).

**New fields:**
- `OrbitSlot.inclination: float = 0.0` — `to_dict()` emits `"inclination"` (2 d.p.) when > 0
- `Star.orbit_inclination: float = 0.0` — `to_dict()` emits `"orbit_inclination"` when > 0
- `TravellerSystem.orbital_inclination: bool = False`

**API:** `parse_orbital_inclination()` added to `shared/helpers.py`; wired through all 5 system endpoints.

**Display:** The "Ecc" column is renamed **"Ecc/Incl"** in both gen-ui and HTML. When both are set, the cell shows `0.123/45.0°`; when only one is set, the other shows `—`; when neither is set, the cell shows just `—`.

**gen-ui:** "Orbital Inclination" checkbox added (enabled only when "System detail" is checked). When False (default), no dice fire — no seed disruption.

---

### Orbital Eccentricity Display Column (Session 44 cont.)

The inline `(e=X.XXX)` text formerly embedded in the AU cell of both the gen-ui System Orbits card and the `to_html()` orbit table has been replaced with a dedicated right-aligned **Ecc** column inserted after **AU**.

- Shows `0.350` (3 d.p.) when `OrbitSlot.eccentricity > 0`; `—` otherwise
- gen-ui detail_attached variant: 11 columns — `Star | Orbit# | AU | Ecc | Type | Profile | Codes | HZ | Zone | Period | Notes`; `right_cols={1,2,3,9}`
- gen-ui non-attached variant: 9 columns — `Star | Orbit# | AU | Ecc | Type | HZ | Zone | Period | Notes`; `right_cols={1,2,3,7}`
- HTML table: `<th>Ecc</th>` added after `<th>AU</th>`; moon sub-row `colspan` widened from 3 → 4
- System map SVG retains the inline `(e=0.35)` in the AU text column (no SVG layout change)

A missing **"Orbital Eccentricity"** checkbox was also added to the gen-ui toolbar row (alongside "NHZ Atmospheres", enabled only when "System detail" is checked). Without this checkbox, `generate_full_system()` was always called with `orbital_eccentricity=False`, leaving every `OrbitSlot.eccentricity` at 0.0 and the Ecc column always showing `—`.

---

### 1:1 Tidal Lock Axial Tilt & Eccentricity (Session 44, issue #10)

WBH p.77 Rules 3 and 4 for 1:1 tidal lock interactions are now implemented.

**Rule 3 — Axial tilt recomputed with 1D on Axial Tilt table.** Previously the 1:1 lock path used `(2D-2)/10` with a `> 3.0` guard (incorrect). New helper `_roll_axial_tilt_1d()` rolls 1D to select the outer band of the Axial Tilt table (the same 6 rows as `_roll_axial_tilt()`), then 1D within the band. The recompute is unconditional — any initial axial tilt is replaced.

**Rule 4 — Eccentricity reduction.** `generate_world_physical()` gains an `orbit_eccentricity: float = 0.0` parameter. When a world reaches 1:1 lock and `orbit_eccentricity > 0.1`, `_reroll_eccentricity_tidal()` re-rolls with DM-2 (using `_ECC_TABLE_PHYS`, an inline copy of the eccentricity table to avoid circular imports). The lower value is stored in new `WorldPhysical.eccentricity_adjusted` (`Optional[float]`, `init=False`). `_attach_mainworld_physical()` in `function_app.py` reads this field and writes it back to the orbit slot, updating the eccentricity that appears in JSON output and system maps.

**Seed impact:** The axial tilt change is seed-breaking for 1:1 locked worlds (same dice count, different interpretation). Eccentricity path only fires for locked worlds with `eccentricity > 0.1` when the orbital eccentricity feature flag is enabled.

---

### Orbital Eccentricity (Session 43, issue #57)

WBH p.27 orbital eccentricity is now implemented as an optional feature gated on `orbital_eccentricity=False`.

**Roll mechanic:** Two dice rolls per orbit. A first `2D+DM` selects a row in the six-row Eccentricity Values table; a second `1D` or `2D` roll divided by a row-specific divisor gives the fractional part. Final value is clamped to [0.000, 0.999].

**DMs (first roll only):**

| Condition | DM |
|---|---|
| Star eccentricities | +2 |
| Each close/near/far star with orbit# < slot (primary slots) | +1 per star |
| Orbit# < 1.0 and system age > 1 Gyr | −1 |
| Belt slot | +1 |

**Min/Max separation:** `AU × (1 − eccentricity)` and `AU × (1 + eccentricity)`

**New fields:**
- `OrbitSlot.eccentricity: float` — `field(default=0.0, init=False)`; `to_dict()` emits `"eccentricity"`, `"orbit_au_min"`, `"orbit_au_max"` when non-zero
- `Star.orbit_eccentricity: float = 0.0` — set for secondary stars by `generate_orbits()`; `to_dict()` emits when non-zero

**Flag plumbing:** `orbital_eccentricity` parameter added to `generate_orbits()`, `generate_full_system()`, `generate_system_from_world()`, and all relevant API endpoints. New `parse_orbital_eccentricity()` helper in `shared/helpers.py` reads the query parameter.

**Display:** System map AU text shows `1.234 (e=0.35)` inline when eccentricity > 0. gen-ui System Orbits card and `to_html()` orbit table each have a dedicated `Ecc` column (see above).

**Seed impact:** Flag False (default) → no new dice, no seed disruption. Flag True → seed-breaking (2 rolls per non-empty slot + 2 per secondary star).

---

### Orbit Notes Column (Session 41 cont.)

`OrbitSlot.notes` is now surfaced in every output that displays the orbit table:

- **gen-ui** — System Orbits card gains a trailing `Notes` column in both header variants: 10 columns (detail attached: `Star | Orbit# | AU | Type | Profile | Codes | HZ | Zone | Period | Notes`) and 8 columns (no detail: `Star | Orbit# | AU | Type | HZ | Zone | Period | Notes`).
- **`TravellerSystem.to_html()`** — orbit table notes cell now uses a `note_parts` list that combines the `"← mainworld"` marker with `OrbitSlot.notes`, showing all notes unconditionally for every orbit row (HZ placement notes, anomaly type notes, etc.).

---

### Anomalous Orbits (Session 41, issue #12)

WBH Step 7 (pp.49-50) is now implemented. After normal orbit placement, `generate_orbits()` rolls for anomalous orbit count (2D: ≤9 = 0, 10 = 1, 11 = 2, 12 = 3) and type.

**Anomaly types:**

| Type | Frequency | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Random | 2D ≤ 7 | Orbit placed anywhere in the star's valid zone |
| Eccentric | 2D = 8 | As random (eccentricity DM deferred) |
| Inclined | 2D = 9 | Inclination rolled (1D+2)×10° + d10; stored in notes |
| Retrograde | 2D = 10–11 | "Retrograde" noted |
| Trojan | 2D = 12 | Co-orbital with an existing non-empty world; 1D ≤ 3 → leading (L4), ≥ 4 → trailing (L5) |

Each anomalous orbit adds one terrestrial (or belt when the maximum of 13 terrestrials has been reached). In multi-star systems the star is chosen randomly from those with available orbit space.

Anomalous orbit positions respect companion exclusion bands (the same valid zone bounds used for normal placement, with ±0.01 clearance from each boundary to avoid landing exactly on the band edge).

**New field:** `OrbitSlot.anomaly_type: str` — one of `""`, `"random"`, `"eccentric"`, `"inclined"`, `"retrograde"`, `"trojan_leading"`, `"trojan_trailing"`. Included in `to_dict()` when non-empty.

**Display:**
- `system_map.py` — anomaly indicator appended to the type column: `"terr *"`, `"terr ~"`, `"terr /"`, `"terr R"`, `"terr L4"`, `"terr L5"`; belts use analogous `"belt ..."` labels
- `TravellerSystem.to_html()` orbit table — anomaly notes shown in the notes column (e.g., `[Inclined 45°]`, `[Trojan leading (L4)]`)
- `SystemOrbits.summary()` text output — same notes shown inline

**Seed impact:** The new `roll(2)` for anomalous count fires for every system — all seeds shift from Session 41 onwards.

---

### Orbital Periods (Session 40)

Kepler orbital periods are now computed and displayed for every star and world in a generated system.

**Stellar periods (`Star.orbit_period_yr`)**

`generate_stellar_data()` computes `P = √(AU³ / (M_central + m))` for every non-primary star after all dice rolls are complete (no seed disruption). Central mass rules follow WBH:
- Companion stars (e.g. Ab orbiting A): M_central = parent mass only
- Secondary stars (e.g. B, C): M_central = combined mass of all stars with effective system orbit# < this star's orbit#

`_eff_sysorn()` ensures that a companion to a secondary (e.g. Ba) uses its parent's orbit# when computing central mass for farther secondaries (so Ca's M_central correctly includes Ba). Periods are included in `Star.to_dict()` and `StarSystem.summary()`.

**World periods (`OrbitSlot.orbit_period_yr`)**

`generate_orbits()` computes `P = √(AU³ / M_central)` for every non-empty orbit slot after placement. M_central = designated star mass plus any companions whose `orbit_au < world.orbit_au` (WBH: worlds outside a tight companion include it in the central mass). Planet mass correction (`mE × 0.000003`) is omitted as negligible. Periods are emitted in `OrbitSlot.to_dict()`.

**Display — `system_map.py` and gen-ui**

- New `Period` column (x=490) in the orbit table of every system map, populated for both star rows and world rows
- `_fmt_period()` module-level helper auto-scales: `< 1 day → Xh`, `1–365 days → Xd`, `≥ 365 days → Xy`
- gen-ui System Orbits card gains a `Period` column in both detail-attached and non-attached variants
- gen-ui Stellar card gains a `Period` column (7 columns total, right-aligned)

---

### System Map — Column Label Sub-header Row (Session 39)

The orbit table in every system map now displays a column label row (`#  Orbit#  AU  Type  Profile  Codes  Zone ♦`) between the star header and the first world row. `Zone ♦` makes explicit that the last column shows both the temperature zone and moon count. `_TBL_ROW0_OFF` bumped from 38 to 50 px to accommodate the new row.

---

### Primary Star Outer Zone Placement (Session 39)

Primary stars in binary systems now populate the outer zone `[companion + 3.0, 17.0]` as well as the inner zone `[MAO, companion − 1.0]`. Previously all primary worlds were placed in the inner zone; the outer zone was unused.

A `star_outer` dict tracks the outer zone bounds. `_avail_range()` includes the outer range in proportional world allocation across stars. The placement loop wraps in a `for zone in zones` iterator that runs once per zone (inner, then outer), keeping the existing baseline → spread → slot logic unchanged within each pass.

Seed-breaking for any primary star that has a close/near/far companion with a valid inner zone.

---

### NHZ Atmosphere Generation (Session 38)

Out-of-habitable-zone worlds now roll NHZ atmosphere codes when the `nhz_atmospheres` flag is set. Two new atmosphere codes are added: code 16 (Gas, Helium / G) and code 17 (Gas, Hydrogen / H).

Four NHZ tables cover the four deviation bands (HZCO ≤ −2.01, −2.0 to −1.01, +1.01 to +3.0, ≥ +3.01). Each table result carries an atmosphere code, an optional exotic subtype key, and display markers. NHZ worlds with an exotic subtype bypass the standard `_roll_exotic_subtype()` roll.

NHZ generation is applied to mainworlds, secondary worlds, and moons:
- `generate_full_system()` and `generate_mainworld_at_orbit()` accept `nhz_atmospheres: bool = False`
- `TravellerSystem` stores `nhz_atmospheres` and threads it through `attach_detail()` to all secondary-world and moon paths
- gen-ui: "NHZ Atmospheres" checkbox added (enabled only when System detail is checked)
- CLI: `--nhz-atmospheres` flag added
- JSON Schema: `atmosphere.code.maximum` updated from 15 to 17

---

### Hydrographic Detail (Session 37)

New module `traveller_hydro_detail.py` implements WBH p.93 surface liquid percentages.

`HydrographicDetail` dataclass carries `surface_liquid_pct` (a flat random value within the WBH code range). `generate_hydrographic_detail()` is called from the shared section of `traveller_system_gen.py` and all API handlers. Exposed in:
- **JSON** — `hydrographics.detail.surface_liquid_pct`
- **HTML** — Hydrographic Detail inner-card in `World.to_html()`, `TravellerSystem.to_html()`, and `World.summary()`
- **gen-ui** — `_build_hydrographic_card()`

---

## Bug Fixes

### JSON Schema Missing `eccentricity_adjusted` Property (Session 49)

`WorldPhysical.to_dict()` emits `eccentricity_adjusted` when `tidal_status == "1:1_lock"` and
`orbit_eccentricity > 0.1` (WBH p.77 Rule 4), but the property was absent from the
`WorldPhysical` branch of `traveller_world_schema.json`. Validation with `jsonschema.validate()`
failed for any such world with the error "is not valid under any of the given schemas ['size_detail']"
(due to `"additionalProperties": false`).

Fix: `eccentricity_adjusted` added as an optional `number` property (`minimum: 0`, `maximum: 0.999`)
to `size_detail.oneOf[0].properties` (the `WorldPhysical` branch). No code change — the schema was
the only gap. The case is rare (requires 1:1 lock **and** `eccentricity > 0.1`), which is why it
was not caught by the existing 200-seed validation sweep in the test suite.

---

### Anomalous Orbit Eccentricity DMs Not Applied (Session 48, issue #64)

WBH pp.49-50 specifies DMs on the Eccentricity Values table for anomalous orbit types.
These DMs were silently ignored — all anomalous orbits used the base table.

| Anomaly type | WBH DM | Was applied |
|---|---|---|
| Random | +2 | No |
| Eccentric | +5 | No |
| Inclined | +2 | No |
| Retrograde | +2 | No |

Fix: added `_ANOM_ECC_DM` lookup dict and `anomaly_dm: int = 0` parameter to
`_roll_eccentricity()`. The eccentricity pass in `generate_orbits()` now passes
`anomaly_dm=_ANOM_ECC_DM.get(o.anomaly_type, 0)` for each orbit slot. No seed
disruption for systems without anomalous orbits. 6 regression tests added
(`TestAnomalyEccentricityDMs`); 1008 tests pass.

---

### Orbital Flags Not Wired Through TravellerMap Endpoints (Session 47, issue #63)

`orbital_eccentricity` and `orbital_inclination` parameters were silently ignored on both `/api/map/system` and `/api/map/system/{name}`. Three layers all missed the flags:

1. `generate_system_from_map()` called `generate_orbits(stellar)` with no keyword arguments and did not accept the flags at all.
2. The shared `_map_system_response()` helper had no `want_ecc` / `want_incl` parameters.
3. Neither endpoint handler called `parse_orbital_eccentricity()` or `parse_orbital_inclination()`.

A fourth gap in gen-ui was also found: `_do_travellermap_generation()` and both its call sites were not forwarding checkbox state.

Fix: flags added to `generate_system_from_map()` signature and threaded into `generate_orbits()` and the `TravellerSystem` constructor. Both `_map_system_response()` and the two endpoint handlers updated to parse and forward the flags. gen-ui call sites updated. 4 regression tests added (`TestGenerateSystemFromMapOrbitalFlags`); 1002 tests pass.

---

### JSON Unicode Error on Windows (Session 45, issue #60)

`open(schema_path)` in `tests/test_traveller_world_gen.py` was called without `encoding="utf-8"`. On Windows, Python defaults to the system codepage (cp1252), which cannot decode the non-ASCII characters in `traveller_world_schema.json` (e.g. `–` U+2013, `…` U+2026). Fixed to `open(schema_path, encoding="utf-8")`, matching the pattern used elsewhere in the test file.

---

### Virtual Environment Consolidated (Session 45, issues #61 and #62)

The dual-environment setup (`.venv` for Azure Functions, `.venv-1` for PySide6/gen-ui) has been replaced by a single `.venv` that contains all dependencies.

- `requirements-dev.txt` added for pytest and pylint
- Install scripts (`install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `install.bat`) now install all three requirements files in one pass and activate the venv at the end
- All `.vscode/settings.json`, `docs/VSCODE.md`, `docs/developer-guide.md`, `docs/uat-plan.md`, and `gen-ui/README.md` updated from `.venv-1` to `.venv`

---

### Incorrect Belt Counts for Fetched Mainworlds (Session 42, issue #52)

Two bugs in `traveller_map_fetch.py` caused the belt count shown in the orbit table to differ from the canonical PBG value on TravellerMap.

**Bug 1 — Pool truncation always dropped belts.** `_reconcile_orbit_types()` built the redistribution pool as `["gas_giant"] * canonical_gg + ["belt"] * canonical_belt` and truncated with `pool[:n]` before shuffling. Because gas giants are at the front of the pool, all GGs were preserved and only belts were dropped when there were too few available orbit slots. Fix: when `canonical_gg + canonical_belt > n`, empty orbit slots are now promoted to world slots before distribution, ensuring the canonical counts are always honoured.

**Bug 2 — Mainworld belt double-counted.** The WBH PBG convention (confirmed at `generate_belt_count()` line 2611) includes the mainworld in the belt count when the mainworld is Size 0. `_reconcile_orbit_types()` was distributing the full `canonical_belt` count among non-mainworld slots, and Step 6 then separately set the mainworld slot to `"belt"`, producing `canonical_belt + 1` total belts. Fix: `generate_system_from_map()` now subtracts 1 from `canonical_belt` before calling `_reconcile_orbit_types()` when `world.size == 0`.

---

### Companion Star Exclusion Zone (Session 39)

When a companion orbit# was less than 1.0, `excl = companion_orbit − 1.0` was ≤ 0 and never triggered the `max_o` cap, allowing primary worlds inside the WBH exclusion band `[companion − 1, companion + 3]`. Fixed: an `else` branch now pushes `mao = max(mao, companion_orbit + 3.0)` and syncs `star_mao[designation]` in-place.

`system_map.py` extended to render companion star rows inside the primary star's orbit-table section, sorted by orbit number.

---

### H/L Oxygen Taint Validation (Session 37, issue #55)

`_roll_single_taint()` now accepts `ppo: Optional[float]` and rerolls High Oxygen (H) results unless `ppo > 0.5 bar`, and Low Oxygen (L) results unless `ppo < 0.1 bar`. The `ppo` computation was moved before the taint block in `generate_atmosphere_detail()` so it is available at taint time. Seed-breaking for tainted atmosphere codes.

---

### System HTML Missing Mainworld Detail (Session 36, issue #51)

`TravellerSystem.to_html()` was omitting the `WorldPhysical` and atmosphere detail inner-cards from the mainworld panel — only `BeltPhysical` was handled. Added `.inner-card`, `.inner-lbl`, `.drow`, `.dlbl` CSS; `drow()` helper; and imports for `WorldPhysical`, `TIDAL_STATUS_LABELS`, and `format_atmosphere_profile()`.

### TravellerMap Fetch Incomplete Atmosphere Pipeline (Session 36, issue #51)

`generate_system_from_map()` was not calling `generate_gas_mix()` or `generate_unusual_subtype()` after `generate_atmosphere_detail()`, leaving gas composition and unusual subtypes absent for TravellerMap-fetched worlds. Also threaded `hz_deviation` into `generate_atmosphere_detail()` for orbit-position DMs. Both calls now follow the same pipeline as procedurally generated worlds.

# Release Notes — v1.1.0

**Branch:** `feature/updates` → `main`
**Sessions:** 23–35
**Tests:** 890 (up from 523 in v1.0)

## New Features

### World Physical Detail

A new module `traveller_world_physical.py` implements the WBH physical world generation rules, producing a `WorldPhysical` record for every non-belt world that has physical detail requested.

**Fields generated:**
- Composition (silicate/ferric/icy/rocky) and density (g/cm³)
- Diameter (km), mass (M⊕), surface gravity (G), escape velocity (km/s)
- Axial tilt, including the full WBH p.77 extreme-tilt sub-table (6-band 1D table producing 20°–179° results)
- Rotation period (day length in hours)
- **Tidal lock status** (WBH pp. 105–107): 11-outcome table covering no-effect, tidal braking (×1.5–×5), prograde/retrograde spin, 3:2 resonance, and 1:1 lock; includes broken-lock check and axial tilt reroll for locked worlds

Physical detail is exposed in all output formats:
- **JSON** — `size_detail` object in world output
- **Text** — `World body` section in `summary()`
- **HTML** — `World body` inner-card in `to_html()`; Size stat box now shows actual rolled diameter and gravity rather than look-up table approximations
- **gen-ui** — new `Physical detail` checkbox (active only when `Full system` is checked); stellar card displays system age; `_build_physical_card()` renders the full physical card below trade codes

---

### Belt Physical Detail

A new module `traveller_belt_physical.py` implements WBH pp. 131–133 for asteroid belts, producing a `BeltPhysical` record for every belt orbit slot — whether a secondary world or the mainworld.

**Fields generated:**
- Belt span (inner and outer AU boundaries)
- Composition percentages: m-type (metallic), s-type (silicate), c-type (carbonaceous), and other
- Belt bulk (2D+2+DMs, minimum 1)
- Resource rating (2–12), with exploitation reduction for Industrial TL 8+ mainworlds
- Significant body counts: Size 1 planetoids and Size S planetoids (with optional outermost-orbit variance)

Belt physical detail is exposed in all output formats:
- **JSON** — `physical` object in `WorldDetail.to_dict()` for every belt slot
- **HTML** — `Belt body` block in the system mainworld panel
- **gen-ui** — `_build_physical_card()` dispatches on `BeltPhysical` to render span, composition, bulk, resource rating, and significant body counts

---

### Atmosphere Detail (WBH pp. 78–93)

Five phases of WBH atmosphere detail have been fully implemented, adding quantitative atmosphere data to every mainworld. All data is exposed in JSON, HTML, text summary, and the gen-ui atmosphere card.

**Phase 1 — Pressure, O₂, and scale height (WBH pp. 78–82)**

A new `AtmosphereDetail` dataclass and `generate_atmosphere_detail()` function compute:
- Surface pressure (bar), sampled from the WBH pressure span table with (2D−7)/100 variance
- Oxygen partial pressure, with DM+1 for systems older than 4 Gyr
- Atmospheric scale height (km), approximated as 8.5 / surface gravity
- WBH p.82 profile string: `{code}-{pressure_bar:.3f}-{ppo:.3f}`, e.g. `6-1.013-0.212` for Terra

**Phase 2 — Atmosphere taints (WBH pp. 82–85)**

Taint generation for tainted atmosphere codes (2, 4, 7, 9), with each taint carrying:
- Subtype (Radioactivity, Particulates, Low Oxygen, High CO₂, etc.)
- Severity (scale 1–9, labelled from "Minor irritant" to "Inevitably lethal")
- Persistence (scale 2–9, from "Constant" to "Rare, brief event")
- Cascade mechanic: Particulates result triggers a second taint roll

Taint suffix appended to profile string as `-T.S.P` per taint.

**Phase 3 — Exotic and corrosive/insidious subtypes (WBH pp. 85–87)**

Subtype rolls for Exotic (code 10/A), Corrosive (code 11/B), and Insidious (code 12/C) atmospheres, with:
- Orbit-position DMs on both subtype tables
- 14-entry Exotic subtype table; 14-entry Corrosive/Insidious subtype table
- Insidious hazards: up to 3 hazard rolls per world, each with optional additional gas
- Unbound pressure subtypes (C/D/E) represented as `None` in the model; displayed as `> 10.0 bar`

**Phase 4 — Gas composition (WBH pp. 87–95)**

Full gas mix generation for Exotic/Corrosive/Insidious atmospheres:
- 7 temperature-banded gas tables (Boiling-VH, Boiling-H, Hot, Temperate, Cold, Frozen-M, Frozen-D)
- 24 named gases, each with an eHex percentage
- CO* substitution: CO → CO₂ when not frozen with water; CO → N₂ when frozen with water
- Gas codes appended to profile string as `:code-##` tokens

**Phase 5 — Altitude bands and Unusual subtypes (WBH pp. 90–93)**

Altitude band computation for Very Dense (code 13/D) and Low (code 14/E) atmospheres:
- Minimum safe altitude above baseline (code 13) or maximum safe depth below baseline (code 14), derived from the WBH Bad Ratio formula: `altitude = ln(bad_ratio) × scale_height`
- `no_safe_altitude = True` when no breathable level exists
- Optional taint roll (1D ≥ 4) for codes 13 and 14

D26 subtype generation for Unusual (code 15/F) atmospheres:
- 12-entry D26 table (11–26) covering Dense subtypes, Ellipsoid, High Radiation, Layered, Panthalassic, Steam, Variable Pressure, Variable Composition, Combination, and Other
- Prerequisite checks: Layered requires size ≥ 9 (gravity > 1.2 G); Panthalassic requires hydro = 10; Steam requires hydro ≥ 5
- Combination result (D26 = 25) produces two independent non-Combination subtypes
- Profile string format: `F-S{code}` or `F-S{code1}.{code2}`, e.g. `F-S7` or `F-S3.A`

## Bug Fixes

### Gas Giant Mainworld Orbit Display (issue #22)

When the mainworld was a satellite of a gas giant, the orbit table showed the satellite's UWP profile (e.g. `A689521-B`) instead of the gas giant's profile (e.g. `GM7`). A secondary symptom caused the satellite to disappear entirely when the gas giant had no additional moons.

Fixed across three layers: `attach_detail()` now uses `orbit.gg_sah` for gas giant mainworld orbits and inserts the satellite as `moons[0]`; `_orbit_profile()` in gen-ui returns `gg_sah` first; `to_html()` in `TravellerSystem` uses `gg_sah` for CSS class and profile display in both detail-attached and no-detail paths.

### Belt Mainworld Display Crash in gen-ui (Session 30)

When generating a belt mainworld with physical detail enabled, `_build_stat_row()` attempted to access `physical.diameter_km` and `physical.gravity` — attributes present on `WorldPhysical` but not on `BeltPhysical`. The uncaught exception left only the header bar visible and silently discarded the scroll area. Fixed with an `isinstance(physical, BeltPhysical)` guard.

### Belt Span Formula Correction (issue #27, Session 30)

Belt span was computed using the AU range of the entire system (`max_au − min_au`) instead of the correct WBH p.131 "system orbit spread" — the per-slot orbital generation step `(max Orbit# − MAO) / n_orbits`. This produced wildly oversized spans (e.g. 0–11.97 AU for a belt at 0.35 AU). After correction, spans are physically plausible (e.g. 0.034–0.662 AU for the same belt). The fix applies to both secondary belts (`generate_system_detail()`) and mainworld belts (`attach_detail()`), with the spread computed per-star.

### Belt Bulk Formula Correction (Session 30)

Belt bulk was computed as 2×D2+DMs (range 2–4 before DMs), inconsistent with WBH p.132 which specifies 2D+2+DMs. Updated to `_roll(2, 2 + dm)` (range 4–14 before DMs).
