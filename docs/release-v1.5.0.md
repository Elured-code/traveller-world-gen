# Traveller World Generator — v1.5.0 Release Notes

**1942 tests pass. Pylint 10.00/10.**

Sessions 88–102. Adds a FastAPI server, mainworld selection, secondary social
pipeline, secondary world classifications, population detail, government detail,
FastAPI web UI split, settlement type population modifiers, full web UI options
parity, save-to-file, atmosphere module extraction, body naming, and assorted
compliance fixes.

---

## Body Naming (Session 102, issue #131)

All system bodies now have auto-generated placeholder names derived from the
mainworld (system) name. A world called "Homeworld" produces:

- Stars: Homeworld-Primary, Homeworld-Secondary, …
- Non-mainworld worlds: Homeworld-A, Homeworld-B, … (terrestrials + gas giants)
- Belts: Homeworld-Belt-A, Homeworld-Belt-B, …
- Moons: Homeworld-A-alpha, Homeworld-A-beta, … (rings skipped)

Names appear as the leftmost column in the orbital survey table in both the
system card and the standalone system detail renderer. They are saved in the
system JSON and restored on reload.

Call `attach_body_names(system)` after `attach_detail()` to populate all names.

---

## City Population Rounding (Session 101)

Major city populations and the total major city population in population detail
are now rounded to 3 significant figures before display and storage. A city of
1,234,567 people is stored and shown as 1,230,000. This prevents spuriously
precise outputs that imply false accuracy in a Monte Carlo generation system.

---

## WBH Social: Government Detail (Session 99, issue #96)

Every inhabited world with a non-zero government code now supports an optional
**Government detail** card. When the "Government detail" option is enabled, the
generator produces a government profile string in the format `G-CAS`
(Government code — Centralisation — Authority — Structure).

- **Centralisation** (Confederal / Federal / Unitary): rolled 2D with DMs for
  government type.
- **Authority** (Legislative / Executive / Judicial / Balanced): rolled 2D with
  DMs for government type and centralisation. Balanced authority generates a
  separate structure for each of the three branches.
- **Structure**: per-government special cases, then the WBH Functional Structure
  table (Demos / Single Council / Multiple Councils / Ruler).
- **Factions**: D3 + DM factions per world, each with government type, strength
  (Obscure → Overwhelming), and relationship to the ruling body.

Government code 0 returns no detail. Government code 7 (Balkanised) is deferred
to issue #130.

The `GovernmentDetail` object is emitted in `World.to_dict()` and restored by
`World.from_dict()`. Secondary worlds carry `WorldDetail.government_detail`.
A dedicated card appears on the world HTML display below Population detail.

24 new tests. 1930 tests pass.

---

## Atmosphere Module Extraction (Session 100)

Atmosphere-derived temperature procedures have been moved into a dedicated
module `traveller_world_atmosphere_detail.py`. `traveller_world_physical.py`
now contains only physical body procedures (composition, density, diameter,
axial tilt, rotation, tidal lock, seismic stress, resource rating).

This is a refactor only — no behaviour change.

---

## Bug Fix: Biodiversity Rating Formula (Session 100)

The WBH Biodiversity Rating formula was incorrectly implemented. The correct
formula `2D − 7 + ⌈(Biomass + Biocomplexity) / 2⌉` (average of both ratings,
ceiling-rounded) replaces the old `2D − 7 + Biomass + ⌈Biocomplexity / 2⌉`.
Results for worlds with high biocomplexity are notably lower under the correct
formula.

---

## FastAPI Web UI — Full Options Parity + Save (Session 98)

The Full System web page now matches every generation option in the desktop app.

**New controls on system.html:**
- NHZ Atmospheres, Biomass Rule, Runaway Greenhouse, Independent Government
  checkboxes (enabled only when Detail or Full is checked).
- Population Detail checkbox (standalone — always available).
- Settlement Type dropdown (Standard / Long-settled / Well-settled / Backwater /
  Unsettled).

**Save functionality (both pages):** after generation a Save group appears in
the seed badge row with download buttons. system.html offers HTML, Text, and
JSON; index.html offers HTML and JSON. Downloads are re-fetched using the
original seed and options, so the file exactly matches what was displayed.

**Backend:** `fastapi/helpers.py` gains `parse_settlement_type()` and
`parse_population_detail()`; system endpoints 3, 5, 7, and 8 in `fastapi/app.py`
now accept and propagate both params. Console output gains timestamps via a
`logging.config.dictConfig` call at module import.

1906 tests pass. No schema changes.

---

## Settlement Type Population Modifiers (Session 97, issue #128)

The gen-ui Options dialog now includes a **Settlement type** group with five
radio buttons. Selecting a type shifts the mainworld population roll up or
down based on the world's atmosphere:

| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Standard (default) | No modifier |
| Long-settled | +1 to +3 (best on breathable atmospheres) |
| Well-settled | −1 to +2 |
| Backwater | −5 to +1 |
| Unsettled | −7 to −4 |

The result is always clamped to the standard 0–10 population range. Not
applied to worlds fetched from TravellerMap. 22 new tests. 1906 tests pass.

---

## FastAPI Web UI — Two-Page Split (Session 96)

The FastAPI web UI is now two separate full-width pages:

- **Mainworld Only** (`/static/index.html`) — generates a mainworld with
  atmosphere and hydrographic detail only (no physical or biological cards).
  Output matches the gen-ui app with System detail and Population detail both
  unchecked.
- **Full System** (`/static/system.html`) — generates a star system with
  tabbed results. The **Mainworld** tab shows the full world card (all detail
  cards via `detail=true`); the **System** tab shows the orbital survey. Detail,
  Full, and Select MW options are available.

Both pages have nav links to each other in the header.

`/api/world/{name}/card` (FastAPI) now accepts a `detail` query parameter:
- `detail=false` (default) — minimal path; atmosphere and hydrographic detail
  only.
- `detail=true` — full path; generates the complete star system, runs
  `attach_detail()`, and returns the mainworld card with all cards shown.

### gen-ui Options dialog

The "System detail" option is now a plain checkbox matching the size of all
other options. Previously it was rendered as a `QGroupBox` title indicator,
which was smaller and differently styled. The sub-options widget is hidden
(not just disabled) when "System detail" is unchecked.

---

## Population Detail — PCR, Urbanisation, Major Cities (Session 95, issue #95)

New `traveller_world_population_detail` module implements the WBH Social
Characteristics checklist for population. When the "Population detail" option
is enabled in the gen-ui Options dialog, every inhabited mainworld and secondary
world receives a full population profile.

**Population Concentration Rating (PCR)** — a 0–9 score indicating how
concentrated the population is. Extremely Dispersed (0) means no major cities;
Extremely Concentrated (9) means the entire population occupies one settlement.
The PCR is rolled on a 1D table with DMs for world size, tech level, government
code, and trade codes.

**Urbanisation** — the percentage of the total population living in towns or
cities of 10,000+ people. Rolled on a 2D range table with DMs including PCR,
population code, and tech level. Some DMs carry hard floors or ceilings on the
result (e.g. Population 9 worlds have a minimum urbanisation of 18 + 1D%).

**Major cities** — determined by one of five cases based on population code and
PCR. Case 1 (PCR 0) produces no major cities; Cases 2–4 handle small or highly
concentrated populations; Case 5 applies the WBH formula
`ceil(2D − PCR + urb% × 20 / PCR)` for large, moderately concentrated worlds.
Individual city populations are allocated from a common pool using the WBH chunk
algorithm (cycling through cities, rolling 1D chunks until the pool is exhausted).

**Population profile string** — a five-part compressed summary: `P-p-C-%-M`
(population code, P value, PCR, urbanisation %, major city count). Example: a
Population 7 world with P=1, PCR=3, 39% urbanisation, and 7 major cities records
`7-1-3-39-7`.

The new `PopulationDetail` object is serialised via `World.to_dict()` and
restored by `World.from_dict()`. The same procedure applies to secondary worlds
(`WorldDetail.population_detail`). A dedicated "Population detail" card appears
on the mainworld HTML display below the Habitability card.

### Schema changes (v1.5.0)

| Field | Location | Type | Change |
|-------|----------|------|--------|
| `population_detail` | World | object (optional) | Added |
| `population_detail.total_population` | World | integer | Added |
| `population_detail.p_value` | World | integer 1–9 | Added |
| `population_detail.pcr` | World | integer 0–9 | Added |
| `population_detail.pcr_label` | World | string | Added |
| `population_detail.urbanisation_pct` | World | integer 0–100 | Added |
| `population_detail.urban_population` | World | integer | Added |
| `population_detail.major_city_count` | World | integer | Added |
| `population_detail.major_city_total_population` | World | integer | Added |
| `population_detail.cities` | World | array of City objects | Added |
| `population_detail.population_profile` | World | string | Added |

The Population detail card appears after Biological detail on the Mainworld tab.
All card section headings are now rendered in bold.

23 new tests in `TestPopulationDetail`. 1884 tests pass.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed `AttributeError: 'World' object has no attribute 'physical'` raised when
  Population detail was enabled. The `attach_population_detail()` function was
  referencing `mw.physical` instead of the correct `mw.size_detail` attribute.

---

## Secondary World Classifications (Session 94, issue #18)

WBH p.163 defines seven roles a secondary world can play in its system. The code
now checks eligibility and rolls in table order, assigning at most one
classification per inhabited secondary world or moon.

| Classification | Code | Requirements | Roll |
|---|---|---|---|
| Colony | Cy | Secondary Pop 5+, Gov 6 | Automatic |
| Farming | Fa | HZ, Atm 4–9, Hyd 2+ | Automatic |
| Freeport | Fp | Secondary Gov 0–5, TL 8+ | 10+; DM−2 if MW starport A/B |
| Military Base | Mb | MW TL 8+, not Poor, Gov 6 | 12+; DM+4 if MW has bases; DM+2 if secondary Gov 6 |
| Mining Facility | Mi | MW Industrial, secondary Pop 2+ | Belt: 6+; Terrestrial: 10+ |
| Penal Colony | Pe | MW TL 9+, LL 8+, Gov 6 | 10+; DM+2 if secondary LL 8+ |
| Research Base | Rb | MW Pop 6+, TL 8+, not Poor | 10+; DM+2 if MW TL 12+ |

`WorldDetail` gains `classification: Optional[str]` (emitted in JSON when set).
The code is also appended to `WorldDetail.trade_codes` so it appears in profile
displays. `_apply_classification()` is called from `generate_system_detail()`,
`_moon_detail()`, and `apply_secondary_social()`. `system_body_table()` appends
`[Classification Name]` to orbit and moon rows.

14 new tests in `TestSecondaryWorldClassification`. 1861 tests pass.

---

## Secondary Social Generation After Mainworld Selection (Session 92 cont.)

After mainworld selection gives the mainworld its real UWP, `apply_secondary_social()`
re-applies social data to every secondary WorldDetail using the correct mainworld
baseline. This includes re-rolling the population cap (`mw_pop − 1D`), and
regenerating population, government, law level, TL, spaceport, and trade codes for
all secondary orbit slots and their moons. The satellite WorldDetail created by
`attach_detail()` (which used placeholder values) is also synced.

---

## Mainworld Selection (Session 92, issue #125)

`select_mainworld(system, rng)` in `traveller_system_gen.py` scores all terrestrial
candidates and promotes the highest-scoring world to mainworld (WBH pp.155–156).
Scoring weights: Habitability ×50, Native sophonts ×50, Resource rating ×30,
Best refuelling ×10 (GG satellite = 2, hydro ≥ 5 = 1, else 0). On a 3D roll of
18 a candidate is selected randomly instead. When a secondary wins, the new
mainworld is regenerated via `generate_mainworld_at_orbit()` and the old
mainworld is demoted to a `WorldDetail`. Returns `True` when a swap occurred.

`WorldDetail` gains `native_sophont: bool` (set by `_set_biocomplexity()` when
biocomplexity ≥ 8; emitted in JSON only when `True`).

Exposed on system endpoints as `select_mainworld=true`; wired in the FastAPI UI as
a "Select MW" checkbox. Not applied on TravellerMap or `from-world` paths.

11 new tests. 1847 tests pass.

---

## Deferred Social Generation — Physical-Only Worlds (Session 91, issue #124)

`generate_mainworld_at_orbit()` now returns a **physical-only** world (SAH,
atmosphere detail, hydrographic detail, gas giant/belt counts). Social steps
(population, government, law, starport, TL, bases, trade codes, travel zone)
are no longer rolled during system generation.

The new `apply_mainworld_social(world, rng=None)` function in
`traveller_world_gen.py` performs the deferred steps and must be called after
mainworld selection. Until then, system-generated worlds carry interim placeholder
values: `starport='X'`, all social codes 0, empty bases and trade code lists, and
`travel_zone='Green'`.

Also fixes a **runaway greenhouse bug**: `atmosphere_detail` and `generate_gas_mix`
are now regenerated when the atmosphere code changes to A/B/C after a greenhouse
conversion in `function_app.py` and `gen-ui/app.py`.

**Note:** seed-breaking change — `generate_full_system()` now produces a different
social outcome for any previously used seed.

---

## FastAPI Web UI (Session 93)

`fastapi/static/index.html` is served at `/`. Two-panel dark-themed page:

- **Mainworld panel** — calls `/api/world/{name}/card` or `/api/world` (JSON);
  shows card, JSON, or text output with a copyable seed badge.
- **System panel** — calls card, full, or JSON endpoints; Detail / Full / Select MW
  checkboxes.
- **Server status indicator** — pings `/api/world?seed=1` on page load.

Other Session 93 changes:

- **gen-ui Chromium noise suppressed** — `QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS=--log-level=3`
  set before `QApplication` construction; silences the harmless
  `TASK_CATEGORY_POLICY` stderr line on macOS.
- **CLI flowcharts** — four Mermaid flowcharts added to `docs/`:
  `traveller_world_gen_flowchart.md`, `traveller_system_gen_flowchart.md`,
  `traveller_map_fetch_flowchart.md`, `system_map_flowchart.md`.

---

## FastAPI Server (Session 90)

A parallel REST server (`fastapi/`) exposes all 11 endpoints of the Azure
Functions API using FastAPI + uvicorn instead of Azure Functions.

- **No authentication** — designed to run behind a gateway or reverse proxy.
- **Rate limiting** — SlowAPI per-IP limiter; configurable via
  `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` env var (default `100/minute`).
- **Run locally** — `cd fastapi && uvicorn app:app --reload` (port 8000).
- **Test coverage** — 130 new tests in `tests/test_fastapi_app.py` using
  FastAPI's `TestClient`; no Azure SDK stubs needed.
- `fastapi/helpers.py` is a flat module (not `shared/`) to avoid import
  namespace conflicts with `azure-api/shared/` when both are on `sys.path`.

---

## Secondary World Independent Government (Session 89, issue #17)

Secondary worlds can now be generated as independently governed (WBH p.162
Case 2) instead of always using the captive/dependent government table (Case 1).
When the new **Independent government** option is enabled in the Options dialog,
every inhabited secondary world (terrestrial, belt, and moon) rolls government as
`2D − 7 + Population` — the same formula as a mainworld — instead of the 1D
captive table. The law level for Case 2 worlds with government 6 uses the
standard `2D − 7 + 6` formula instead of the captive-government relationship
table. `WorldDetail` gains an `is_independent_government` boolean field emitted
in JSON when `True`. The option is disabled by default and persisted in QSettings.

7 new tests in `TestIndependentGovernment`. 1706 tests pass.

---

## Larger Worlds for Non-Mainworld Terrestrial Bodies (Session 88, issue #113)

Secondary terrestrial worlds with size 10–15 (eHex A–F) now use the full WBH
`2D-7+Size` atmosphere formula. Previously both `_terrestrial_sah()` and
`_moon_detail()` in `traveller_world_detail.py` capped the size at 9 when
calling `generate_atmosphere()`, meaning a size-12 super-Earth got the same
thin atmosphere roll as a size-9 world. The cap is replaced with
`min(generate_atmosphere(size), 15)`, applying the correct size DM while
clamping to code 15 (F — Unusual Atmosphere) to exclude NHZ-only codes 16–17.
SAH encoding (`to_hex()`) and `WorldDetail.profile` parsing already handled
sizes A–F correctly; no other changes required.

10 new tests in `TestLargeSecondaryWorldAtmosphere`. 1699 tests pass.
